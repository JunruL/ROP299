7,class,"The preperation material for class is often released right before the live zoom class leaving little time to revise and understand the content. This isn\'t helped by the frequent small group activities (""breakout rooms"") where we\'re left to answer many questions without much pre-existing knowledge. During these breakout rooms, the instructors allow us to direct the pace of the lesson and we can ask questions when we need to. Therefore, I would want class material made available earlier (a week early) and for instructors to lead the class and offer more opportunities for discussion. \n\nAnother aspect is the pace and structure of classes. There are classes that are organised to the very minute... but you leave the class having learnt nothing and more confused than ever. There are other classes where it runs for 4 hours and the instructors just chat to each other and to other students via the live chat... and you leave having learnt everything you need. I think it depends on the kind of content being covered and how familiar the class is with the content. I\'d want each class structure to be suited to the content being covered as well as the level of familiarity the students have with the content e.g. a new topic, computer software, lab skill.

7,team,"Short answer: reduce the amount of team projects and provide students with more small assignments to make sure everyone is following the guideline for the course (procrastination is our worst enemy when it comes to online classes). \nUnnecessarily long answer: I don't think I would change anything about my current classes. I believe my professors did the best they could given the situation (the schools were shut down on the 13th of March and my classes went online between the 15th and the 17th, so they had very little time to prepare). For the next semester, which will also be entirely online, I hope they would reduce the workload in terms of team projects. I understand that it is necessary for certain classes and that it allows social interactions to an extent, but it is really difficult to do in this context. From my classmates' perspective, I am certainly not an ideal candidate as my work schedule varies extremely. Also, some people are not equipped to have online live meetings and dividing the tasks does not really qualify as a team work in my opinion (might as well do it individually).

7,format,"I would recommend my teachers to change the format, make it differ from our usual classes on campus, so for example share with us online articles, diagrams, illustrations and other online documents. Also, it is a good occasion to add more reading material to the courses (meaning additional books, articles and so on) that we can then discuss in class. I regret that we stay on a very basic format, even though the online format allows us to explore more material, in order to understand better our subject.

It’s chaotic. I would wish for the classes and seminars to have somewhat of a structure; everyone seems to be doing what he wants and no one is talking to another or asking the students what they prefer. Since the professors often change throughout the semester, it’s even more chaotic. So if I would change one thing, it would be to give everything more structure and I would wish for more communication between the professors.

For example, my math class has weekly quizzes that are normally 4-5 questions in class but they became 7-8 questions that we had to do on our own time after we moved online. Exams also became more convoluted due to different online restrictions and student accommodations. If we continue with online education for the next semester I think my school needs to set up universal guidelines and procedures for online testing. My exams this semester were different for every class and it added to the confusion. For example I had a Korean exam that was on a google survey like this that we took while on zoom. My computer science exam was also on zoom but it consisted of all programming questions done on python. One of my math exams was done on our own time, meaning we had 2 days to take a 2 part exam and we had to film ourselves taking it. After the results showed a lot of cheating we took the final exam on zoom and the formatting had to be changed.

Online you can’t turn to the person next to you and ask a question.

Although this does force me to maybe work things out more by myself first, I find it can be quite demotivating and frustrating, as well as time-consuming. However, as mentioned before, this isn't a viable option, due to unequal access, but our lecturers have done a really good job of making sure we can get hold of them via many platforms, including WhatsApp groups and email.

I cannot comprehend how on earth I'm supposed to fit both my mouth and computer screen in the same shot?? And both documents are part of the official instructions for how to do the exam... And let's not even begin to think about things like the fact that it's on us students to make sure we don't lose internet connection, have a battery failure on the camera or something else so that it stops recording, because if it does it sounds like they'll give us a failing grad straight away.
