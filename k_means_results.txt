I find it's extremely different to study with a teacher's commentary and support, than without it. Lectures are non-negotiable and I'm glad we can continue the teacher-student engagement live.

This would be my preferred mode of online teaching because it simulates the real teaching situation the best. You still are tied to a schedule and you can't replay parts of the lecture you missed because you weren't paying attention. I think this is a good thing, because with the recorded lectures I tend to replay every bit I missed, so the lectures take way more time and 'brain power'. Also with the recorded lectures it's harder to have a schedule, because the teachers do not upload consistently. way 1

Because in pre recorded videos professors tend to  rush through the video really quickly (and therefore have one explanation, if you do not understand it, that is really sucks) or professors take more time than the original lecture time.

You can work at your own pace and play things back if you didn't understand things properly.

All our courses are 2/3 Zoom lectures and 1/3 recorded lectures. I prefer recorded lectures because I have the ability to pause at any given time.

Interactive learning  prerecord 4
In India, there are many places which do not have access to the internet (for ex - Jammu and Kashmir). Online classes which are conducted on platforms, such as Zoom, happen at a certain time. What if a student has a really poor connection to the internet while the class is being conducted? They miss out on it. This is why I prefer Discussion forums/chats over other modes because it stores information for a time when the student would be able to have access to the internet. I am anyway against online learning because it excludes many student who do not come from very privileged backgrounds. But discussion on chats can still be used to make it all a little more inclusive. pauserepeat 0

Having live classes online kept some form of routine as of I was going to college. Although there were positives out of the pre-recorded lectures, they often allowed me to work when I chose.

I think live classes have a better level of engagement than the other options, though ideally I think they should be recorded and uploaded for later reference. I think if the classes aren’t live then it is difficult to be self-disciplined and pace work which leads to rapid accumulation of stress towards the end when assessments approach. I also think live classes feel most worthwhile, as when work is entirely pre-recorded or just uploaded online then psychologically it is a major challenge to work through and you feel alone in your efforts, whereas with live classes you feel more in contact with classmates/professors. close 3

Recorded lectures are easier and more convenient to access. Live classes do help you maintain discipline and complete course material on time. However, due to wifi or load shedding we are unable to connect to live lectures. If I miss a part of the lecture then I'm unable to grasp the whole topic (idk if it's relevant but I'm an Accounting and Finance major) 
Also our professors aren't really trained to conduct online classes so the lectures aren't interactive and we lose focus. So there really isn't much difference between a recorded and live lecture. At least we can pause recorded lectures and understand the topic in detail through the reading material.  interrsct 0

Living in a third world country, the internet is unstable most of the time so having zoom meetings would be a hassle for a lot of students easili 2
Because the Philippine education is teacher centered and attending live classes is just listening to a monologue of a teacher at a slow pace. The only thing pulled up is the powerpoint slide and most of them don’t know how to annotate or to write on the ppt or just don’t have the resources like an ipad or apple pencil. So it gets really confusing when there are no visuals.  And it is very awkward to ask questions or to engage because some teachers could get really annoyed because we disrupt her pace. It is not a mode of teaching problem per se but it just has to do with the culture of learning here. With recorded videos, I can watch the lectures in 2x speed.  record 2

Online live classes are much harder to sit through (for me) because of all the noises and weird video interaction (it's obviously not the same as a live class, it feels more like watching a movie and interacting with it), it was kind of exausting. If I have to listen to a prerecorded lecture I don't have to interact with anyone and I can do it in my own time (so that I don't have to sit in front of the camera for five hours straight) and I still can ask questions via email or something like that, so I feel like this isn't less efficient but more comfortable chatsforum 0

As I can follow at my own pace and can skip ahead if I feel I understand or I can pause to copy down examples/try and understand more, while still having it explained by my lecturer (instead of just using the notes). I cannot fully say whether I would prefer live classes as I only have 1 zoom session a week for 1 course, as not everyone at our university has equal access to data (even though all students have been provided with data, live sessions use up a lot more data than typed notes or video transcripts) and not everyone has working/living conditions where they can access a session at a specific time. This means that we are provided with typed notes and the recorded lectures are optional, but it makes it hard for me to decern whether I prefer live sessions due to the fact that our university doesn't recommend their usage. person 3

My internet is not good enough for a live class to be done properly. Moreover, my online classes are with the camera off and mic of and questions are asked in the chat.

It does depend on the class. I like the combination of live classes and recorded lectures. Live classes are great for asking questions in tutoring classes and discussion-based content whereas recorded lectures allow me to follow my own schedule and revisit parts I found difficult to understand. I can pause the lecture when I need to think more about the presented concept. On the other hand live classes structure my day and hold me accountable.

The forums we’ve been using for seminars makes it so hard for discussions - you have to wait a lifetime to type a question and hope to get a decent response while there’s other conversations going on and it’s super awkward - whereas the zoom classes I think have been making talking to my tutors and the discussions way more accessible  watch 2
Because it is a good mix between guidance from our seminar leader and contributions from classmates which makes it so much more engaging. A lot more students feel more confident to contribute compared to zooms so it is far more interesting to spark debate. spars 0

We get to recreate the seminar dynamic. Not exactly the same but we get to have actual back and forth conversations about the content whereas the discussion boards weve had to use in some other classes are awful they dont replicate the seminar experience at all because you dont have w conversation, its more like you write a paragraph, send it and thats it. Video calls also mean there is a set time you have to complete reading for and show up, whereas with discussion boards we have a whole week to contribute so there is a lack of conversation because it is staggered over days, and there is no incentive to answer before the day of the deadline. tutornot 0

I have quite intense anxiety which was made worse by the lockdown, the pressure of having to log on and speak online to other students, most of which I hadn’t met because it was a new module, was nerve-wracking ! I barely like phone calls to people I already know so having to do online seminars with a new teacher and new class really affected my mental health. Like when the teacher asked if we had questions, I felt to nervous and anxious to turn my mic on, so ended up dealing with any issues over email anyway. A lot of what we dealt with in class easily could’ve been done through materials emailed to us and teacher feedback rather than awkwardly waiting for someone to speak in the online classroom. Mostly I’d prefer the emails and forums due to my anxiety but also because I can easily re-access that content if I need it. chat 3

- The ability to access and re-access in your own time (You might miss a point during a Live Class and then you're unable to go back, also there's a pressure to try and write notes whilst also contributing, which can lead to things being easily missed)
- Allows students to work at their own pace 
- More accessible for student's with mental health conditions (eg. anxiety disorders), who may struggle to attend and contribute during live sessions
- Less awkward (There is just something quite weird and uncomfortable sometimes about the live class format, it feels somehow more obvious if you haven't contributed and your constantly forced to analyse and think about your own contribution to the session)
- Feels the most like the traditional university experience
- Students learn better at different times of day, and so forcing some students to wake up early to engage in a session might be utterly useless to them bc they are able to focus/concentrate much better later on in the day, recorded lectures allow students to tailor their learning experience to what best fits them

I would prefer tasks to do ie. research, workbooks with supplementary recorded lectures and optional live class discussions - it’s difficult for many people to join due to lack of laptop/internet access or the lack of a quiet space to join calls so I don’t believe they should be mandatory or the only way of getting important info. emailed materials can be used with just pen and paper, my younger siblings have had work packs delivered by post and found this most effective (trying to use minimal resources as possible would be key here to be environmental of course). I also feel like just having lectures from past years isn’t as useful and feels less relevant/motivating to be paying the full tuition fees and just receiving a link to a podcast from 2015?
