0,420,I find my university isn't up to date with how learning actually works. There is no point in my opinion to spend 2 hours simply reading slides. I think they should be more interactive and make sure the students actually understand the material. Because the tests and exams aren't about knowing only what was on the slides but about how to apply the material. We have one class (organic chemistry) where the average of the class was of 4/20 the past years. The professor on question said it was students faut for not studying enough. However I think that if the average is of 4/20 the problem is probably with the professor.,find univers isnt date learn actual work point opinion spend 2 hour simpli read slide think interact make sure student actual understand materi test exam arent know slide appli materi one class organ chemistri averag class 420 past year professor question said student faut studi enough howev think averag 420 problem probabl professor

Therefore it would be clearer if people don’t understand something.

This is difficult due to timetabling where back-to-back classes are often inevitable (some majors do so on purpose 😩). Often students need to travel long distances to get to another class on time.

And I wish syllabi were mandatory for all teachers to give, because sometimes class _really_ doesn't cut it, and then you need to work on the material at home, but how do you do that if you don't even really know what the material is, because you have no syllabus for that class.
