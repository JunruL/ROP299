i’m in more control of when i do it
more time to consid my own thoughtsopinion can be return to after the session and therefor more access to those who cannot attend a real time session
facetofac class
it difficult to set the right amount of work i have a tendenc to overdo it but a live lesson is a compact block of time that mean it is equal for everyon no one doe too much or too littl work
record lectur allow me a lot of flexibl i can listen to them whenev and i can also go back and listen again if i need to
can ask question and talk to other student

far more interact and similar to a classroom also nice to interact with teacher and friend

studi at home can prove to be veri distract but live lesson allow me to be fulli engag with the cours also it’ nice to commun with other
it involv interact with the teacher and the class it probabl the closest to reallif school
i get to socialis with those in my class
im get more out of everi class then it isnt just the teacher talk or that we need to make an individu assign
keep routin
i am an introvert so i video are better than zoom
it more natur and when someon teach me someth i understand it better than read it myself
as student we get to interact and ask question and we receiv a repli instantli
as it keep my attent longer i get to interact with peer
not onli is it an onlin class but it also allow everi student to discuss and voic their own opinion and get involv in class like normal
the face to face interact make it easier for us to ask teacher when we don’t understand someth
becaus you can ask question as you are be taught as soon as you are unsur about someth and receiv a face to face respons
i’m abl to interact with the teacher and ask question directli and when they aris becaus i usual forget them
the opportun to still have a deliv lectur with more understand and opportun to ask question my cohort for my cours is onli small so lectur are alway a discuss aswel

i feel that it is more person and i like have real time interact with my teacher and classmat
more social interact possibl
more interact and foster a better discuss than a simpl upload
can be done at your own pace
my internet connect isnt the best so despit the fact that i love interact with my professor and ask question it easier to have a record lesson that i can go back to and have note luckili they all record their live session for us to keep
it more interact and i person more close associ it to the normal lectur we use to have ay school as oppos to record lectur
especi in scienc instant feedback and commun is key
i prefer to have live interact with lectur and other student pre record lectur restrict the twoway teach that live lectur offer
i dont particularli like ani howev i like be abl to go back over what wa said to avoid me get confus as dure thi time i am find concentr difficult
can ask question
abil to ask question

it’ more interact and give student more opportun to learn from one anoth
you can have quick and easi convers and actual see what your teacher is talk about
abl to listenwatch whenev you want
zoom
becaus that way i dont have to follow my normal schedul and can choos the best time to studi a certain subject
can answer and ask as mani question as i want without feel awkward or naggi
it would be my prefer mode if my school were to utilis it the email resourc have been few and far between for a school with a high reput
more activ engag

more interact
upload assign allow me to work at my own pace reduc stress and allow me to be more effici at home
don’t like video harder to follow and learn at same time
so if we are unabl to be at the live lectur for whatev reason we do not miss out on a lectur
it good to have immedi access to the teacher and still have that element of socialis with other student and have discuss
most interact
it allow student to absorb inform at their own pace abl to paus if lectur is record also student with anxieti or poor mental health in lockdown dont have to feel worri about answer question on the spot they are also rewatch
when the lesson is as face to face as possibl it is far easier to feel engag and normal
becaus you can actual engag with your lectur to a certain point
more interact with teacher
becaus you have to be there it help to structur your time and mean you can’t get behind
allow me to paus and replay to realli make sure i could understand the content
i‘m alon when completingunderstand work and it is reassur that i can see other peopl ask question be confus etc it feel more like normal school and i we can’t be overset work if it is live
i feel as though i’m get as much inform as i would in a facetofac lectur instead of just make note from the powerpointlectur slide that i have been given i have no extra materi
you can skip forward and watch the lectur faster or repeat certain part
it’ more engag
i can interact with my teacher and peer easili and it’ easier to understand the content
i find it harder to motiv myself to join a live class than just watch record or discuss forum it just make me more anxiou but i didn’t have that problem when actual go to lecturesseminar

structur and interact

lectur seem to be more thorough when talk to themselv
better engag but also flexibl
we can ask question while the teacher is teach so we have the feel that we are in an actual classroom
can do it at my own pace in my own time
i prefer do class over zoom becaus you still have that valuabl discuss time with both teacher and student and it help to develop our ideasdepth of subject
becaus i can check them out and keep up with them whenev i want without the respons of catch up on the live class
live lesson allow us to ask question to the professor directli via the chatbox thi would not be possibl with record lectur have live lesson sort of also help us to creat a routin whilst in quarantin have to attend class at specif time just like in school instead of just do the lesson whenev you want

better deliveri of inform
abl to go at your own pace but also video is more engag than just look through worksheet and powerpoint slide
easier to ask the teacher question live but there is still a signific barrier when the teacher ha to end the zoom without ask if we have question in return i feel less prepar and thu less motiv to tackl assign becaus i didn’t understand the materi to begin with
i can rewatch the video whenev i need to and can paus it and do it at my own pace
go at own pace

it is the most “normal” kind of teach compar to how it wa befor lectur gener work realli well for me and the limit amount of student particip make it easili transfer into a zoomlectur
our school combin upload materi with six zoom session per school day i prefer the assign becaus they depend on me and i get to complet them on my own schedul with the deadlin in mind addit we use googl classroom which enabl privat feedback from teacher on assign that is less possibl with the whole class
most like a normal lectureseminar

it feel like be in a classroom and you can understand the content better with someon teach you
feel most like irl lectur and class i feel most product even though they are not the method in which i necessarili get the most done howev they are the method where i feel most account

i can decid when i do my assign and make my own schedul
becaus i am abl to ask question while the professor is explain and also it give me some kind of routin and i can be more product also they record the lesson as hey do them live so i can listen to them again and even listen to the answer to the question
while we are social distanc thi provid more contact with other
i like the ‘face to face’ feel on a zoom call and i think it’ easier for the teacher to explain while i listen and take in the inform like i do in a classroom
it is less interact and can be done on ani time which is realli help dure difficult day in lockdown
i understand best when i can have someon explain the concept to me zoom may also be a good option but my school ha not organ that
flip classroom lectur were you do a bit of pre read and solv and discuss problem dure class
you can interact with your teatcher and dont have to send in your question with the fear they might not get answerd
more engag and make the learn process easier
it allow chanc to do work alon hand in the assign and get feedback without have to do a whole class discuss
creat a sort of routin
it give you time to comprehend the materi in your own method and your own time and requir you to deepli understand the materi instead of just listen to a lectur while half asleep
it help when i need to ask the teacher someth right away it more practic and easier to commun
becaus it’ easier to follow and to write note
becaus it allow you to alloc your own time
becaus then you can get the need inform and also ask question if you don’t understand
ensur you actual do the lectur rather than think “it’ll be there anyway so i’ll do it in my own time”
record lectur help us to learn at our own pace as a person who also do acca alongsid graduat it kinda hard to keep up with the time teacher set for the class becaus it onli conveni to them
becaus thi way i can do schoolwork whenev i want to and can plan my time howev i wish
it wa more or less like be in class
becaus it allow us to paus the video and take the time need to fulli understand the subject of the cours we can learn at our own pace and don’t have to just take note of the lesson without think about what we are writ
more interact and worth the money
it realli help to learn all the work in first year when i hear or see the lectur talk it make do all the work seem less autom and like i am still interact with a human be behind all the cours work
abil to ask question as you go mirror a school environ
it’ much easier when you can have an open dialogu rather than receiv email with far too much inform in them
i’m more motiv to actual do the work that we are set if it’ in a live lesson
face to face interact make me feel like my work actual matter and encourag me to actual work
i learn so much from seminar as an ma as the topic are quit difficult so it help when we discuss it togeth
it forc me to do my work howev i may be attend a uni oversea thi fall and if i have to stay in the us and do zoom callsexam a 4am imma die
i prefer interact teach sinc i feel like i asorb the content more when im taught it rather than tri to figur it out
you get a chanc to talk to your teacher and ask question
it give us the opportun for realtim commun and feedback
you can alway refer back to the materi you aren’t under pressur to write everyth down as the lectur in say it and can instead focu on the materi i also find that i can cover lectur materi quicker independ compar to if class were live where you can’t skip certain element which you understandfind easier
send note onli is not enough you can also watch video again if you didn’t get it the first time
you can work at your own pace and it is more indepth and understand than email materi
it easi sinc im a health care student who also ha to attend clinic placement
more engag
it is more interact and engag i am on a small cours and be abl to have discuss to help understand the materi is super use
easi to use at my own pace and refer to whenev
i feel like when you interact more with the professor and your classmat that you learn more from the class
it provid us with learn session that in my opinion are the most similar to those that use to be at school befor covid 19
i can have a verbal discuss with my lectur
it forc you to get studi and it give you some king of schedul
i tend to be more focus as i feel the pressur to pay attent to the lesson becaus of the fact that your teacher can actual see you
you can work though at your own pace
becaus it seem more normal we interact and there is a schedul so i dont get late on my work
becaus as i do french and german i am abl to speak in the target languag and have debat and discuss which is someth i realli valu
it resembl “normal” lesson as much as possibl i prefer the interact
it’ veri similar to be in the classroom without the pressur of be on an onlin call you can work at your own pace with the aid of your teacherlectur there to provid the basic inform
it’ realli easi to work and more benefici
hard to stay motiv and concentr dure a zoom call
can watch it in my own time and skip the bit i know
live class help me get all my doubt clear the second i have them plu with a2’ next year i can’t afford to not understand the content im be taught
it’ the closest thing we could get to an actual seminar all of my cours thi year have been conduct in 3 hour seminar ie no lectur so thi wa the onli real option we had
i am abl to ask question there and then
so i know what info i need to learn to get the grade i want
feel more like an actual class
im better at learn by myself than from call as teacher tend to simplifi everyth as they have to teach peopl of differ level
abl to go at your own pace lectur seem to talk slower and explain idea better than on video call
it give me an opportun to commun with my lectur and other student in a way that will be benefici and quicker than just email them and wait for a respons
i prefer the interact with teacher and the abil to catch up discuss and ask question as well as learn content it creat normal in these crazi time
i can do the work in my own time
independ and can be done at your own pace
live materi is be taught so there can be interact
forc me to keep up w the materi vs record lectur addit it give me contact hour with the professor which i find give me motiv to keep studi even though it been harder to do so
my degre is veri theoret in natur i benefit most from appli the theori to question that lectur give it is so easi to zone out of onlin class so discuss forum almost forc you to stay on track
forc me to keep up with the work live
i feel that record lectur i can take my time to fulli understand the content in my own time and if i still don’t understand someth i can email lectur
it’ nice to see everyon from school also it give more structur to my day as the live lesson are at specif time it’ nice to have a routin
allow you to work through materi at your own pace and go into as much depth as you need
all cohort particip at the same time
thi is the onli mode i’m use to and thi way i can interpret the inform in my own way to help me understand and memoris it furthermor i’ll have continu access to thi inform and will be abl to revisit it someth you cannot do with live class
free to do the work when best suit you
you are abl to ask question then and there is you are unsur about someth
it allow for a more interact experi between student and teacher and motiv me to be more involv
becaus it engag but i can keep it at my own pace
i can take note and stop the lectur if i need more time or doubl the speed if i understand a topic more easier and want to take less time for it
becaus it can keep me focus provid that we are requir to turn on our camera
instant answer and help
give more structur to the day than if it’ just set and nice to see friend and teacher
becaus you can interact with other as oppos to just watch lectur
becaus i dont want to feel judg from my peer
live interact
can interact with lectur in real time
record lectur
record video
becaus we can ask question at the moment and we will be answer at the same moment
i prefer do school work by myself i am usual most product when do so
the materi stick more that way and live teach allow for on the spot question
it feel as if we are more connect
it nice to have face to face interact
i learn more i find it easier to focu
as the live class were veri time consum and some peopl could not get adequ internet connect at the specif time
in live class teach don’t tend to get to the point and often work could just be sent to us and it would be just as good but more effici
it’ easier to commun despit the connect issu everyth can be done there and then
becaus it still allow class interact even if the class is physic apart
it’ easier to understand concept hear someon els explain them in a video
it is difficult to learn just by look and read inform
help me to stick to a routin allow for proper discuss and interact
engag with your teacher and get immedi help
becaus it’ the one who resembl facetofac lesson at school the most
it easier to understand new content through video rather than read it almost the same as be in a class
it give me a routin and i still get to commun with my classmat my teacher will often leav the zoom open after class is done so we can talk on our own
you get the explan properli from the teacher and aren’t go at it alon but you also can access it after to make more note etc
live class fee more interact
it is interact and way more easier to understand
the interact natur of offlin class is best recreat with live video class
the record can be access multipl time paus and slow if need they also have much fewer disrupt versu love lectur as are not affect by poor connect etc
easi to interact
it give more chanc for interact dure lectur and tutori which help in understand
i suffer from anxieti and find the discuss over zoom overwhelm especi with the camera onto the point that i just avoid them
easi to go back over
more interact and it’ good to see your teacher and other peer in your class
becaus you can do it at your on pace and when the lectur are record in a good qualiti it is like watch an interest youtub video or listen to a podcast
easier interact with the teacher and other student
becaus i can activ take part to the class feel use and inspir to immedi transform the taught materi to some knowledg
becaus of the interact which help for a better understand
it provid a schedul for my day and it’ a lot easier to pay attent and focu on learn when there’ an actual teacher’ presenc howev it’ tricki becaus it’ hard to be effect over zoom for some teacher and i’v had pretti useless zoom class that feel like actual wast of my almost endless time also schedul conflict and unreli wifi
it allow me to work in my own time
more interact with class teacher
it forc me to do the school work fulli and effici
easier as live class aren’t alway necessari
still receiv the same amount of detail if not more as we would in normal facetofac lectur can also paus and play to make more detail notesget a better understand of the topic
most product
becaus i can’t slack off and can ask question dure a live class
becaus i can repeat it as often as i want
it almost feel like real class it easier for the teacher to explain and easier for the student to understand
actual connect to teacher in order to ask question if we don’t understand or have ani question

so i don’t bave to be on camera
can watch at my own time and pace but still hear a voic
it make it easier to take note and actual understand content rather than teach myself
learn through email doesn’t work properli as you can’t absorb content
googl classroom assign
less stress more flexibl and the materi is easier to understand
becaus it open up a room for discuss and you get to interact with the other student and teacher
space for interact regardless connect wa often a problem i like it when teacher record and upload the lesson
i can work at my own pace
becaus i can stop the video if i dont understand someth i am studi math and lectur are veri “passive” so you understand more if you have more time to think about it
i dont like watch the onlin lectur
becaus you can question the teacher about anyth your unsur of it give structur to your day and you feel like your do proper work not just halfass effort to get someth done also i feel accomplish and the time that it take to go through someth like a languag comprehens will significantli decreas if a teacher help with it as i dont have the time to look up everi singl thing i dont understand it just much more effici than upload materi that you have to tri and teach yourself
i like work to my own schedul and at my own pace
it is more interact
i learn the best from someon explain the materi live class can also be use but our professor prefer record their lectur and im kind of use to it by now
you get that social aspect you get to connect with your teacher more which help you feel more comfort with them add a hint of normal
more interact can ask question and just feel most like be at school
better commun
there is more room for interact in our prerecord cours it’ often just a powerpoint with audio and it’ easier to concentr if you actual see your professor andor classmat i think it’ easier to ask question in a live lesson and that you’r more involv
becaus it give me a reason not to postpon do the work
it allow you to have a deeper explan on the topic while be abl to organ how much time you want to spend on each one
becaus in thi method you have account to engag with the materi in real time but can access it after the teach time my univers record and upload all lectur in normal time so thi would also be in line with usual teach practis
becaus i can do it in my own time
becaus it’ the most interact way of teach onlin
i understand materi better if it ha been explain to me
as it would push me to have deeper convers
i can do everyth in my own pace i can take my time and paus or rewind someth to get a better understand
i can ask question in real time
it work the easiest
it more activ interact and i see my fellow classmat
i can replay the video to fulli understand the content and i can watch it whenev i want
it’ flexibl and feel less formal than have to do a live onlin call which is nicer for be at home
it’ more easi to retain thi inform
it is more flexibl when it come to schedul
becaus i can rewatch the lesson anytim even when i’m have lunch it’ in gener easier for me to focu on what the teacher is explain becaus i can go back and i can even stop it to take note
it allow you to ask question and get a respons in real time
give opportun for student to ask question to teacher and for teacher to explain the materi and provid guidanc with assign

it’ easier to go back if you miss part of it
closest to usual method of learn
caus it easier to take note
i like to read inform and complet task base on that as oppos to attend call where there’ more pressur and more of an expect
it’ the onli one i’v use and avail to me
it’ like be in a lesson at school but with the bonu of go at my own pace and i am abl to rewatch bit i may not understand straight away
becaus we can ask question and be actual present in the situat make it easier to pay attent and lear
i can easili ask question and the teacher is actual abl to explain and goe through tricki topic
if my class were live i think it would easier to understand as email are harder to understand
you can paus rewind it’ easier to take note
i like be abl to complet my work on my own schedul
can ask question
easi to do at my own pace
abl to ask question and activ particip dure instruct
we onli have a zoom call for math and i must say it realli help but of cours it is not the same as school itself for other subject we are complet on our own
easiest to commun in
i dont feel as pressur as when i have to go on video call
i like live class becaus you can ask question in the moment and debat with your teacher and classmat also you can benefit from question and comment other make
it allow me to replay it isnt so tire as sit through whole class
you can interact and share idea and it motiv you to actual wake up and have a routin like you would at univers when you have schedul class and deadlin
it more interact and i feel a lot easier to ask for help and as i do re i have complex text to understand so it would be nice to have them explain a bit

i can watch thi later on instead of onli get one chanc to listen
the work we are receiv is simpl and low volum and it can be complet at one own pace
more interact and i keep up with the work more easili rather promis myself that ill catch up on it later
more interact
you are abl to ask question at live time rather than have a delay respons
allow you to interact but give you time to understand the content
becaus i can listen to it again if i need to
i am abl to go through the materi at my own pace
becaus it allow you to interact more in the class and ask ani question that you have straight away rather than have to email the lectur and wait for a respons
i find it easier to take factual note from a video which i can paus and consum in my own time and re visit if need
closer to normal teach
you can ask question straight away and is more of a classroom format than just get sent work to do
i’m abl to do it whenev i want and i can speed it up slow it down put it on paus etc if i need to
get more real time interact with friend and peer i have the abil to ask question and get a live respons
there more pressur to watch it bc if i dont i cant get it back also live question and interact with teacher
it give student the chanc to interact dure the lectur

becaus i am much better abl to focu and understand the content when my teacher and classmat are with me
it creat a more person atmospher make me feel part of the class
abil to ask question and feel the « presenc » of my classmat though that wa particularli true for class that had been held in person befor ie knew peopl in the class for class onlin from the start of the semest my last comment might defer
abl to ask question in real time
when they are live i am forc to keep up when they are prerecord i can watch them whenev i want and can easili put it off and get behind

it add a lot of structur to your day
more interact better valu for money
more interact than the other method and easier to ask for helpdiscuss
it is more interact and engag i am also abl to ask question whilst cover the materi
less awkward and more product than video call where i feel like a lot of time is wast
some video have the script for the record video too i enjoy read them sinc it doesn’t have as much time as watch the video and then take note
i like the possibl to ask question in the moment they come up i do appreci it though if the onlin class is record and can be rewatch to go over the materi again
i would actual engag with the class if it wa live but it take me forev to watch a record lectur
it is the most like face to face teach
i’d rather have a teacher teach me where we can ask question live than have to read a textbook or watch a movi and teach myself
i like be abl to the work in my own time and do as much as i want sometim and not other
you can do the work in ur own time
engag with teacher

it the most similar way of teach that isnt in the classroom it more engag than just email
it provid a sens of structur to my day sinc it’ at a set time and bring back a bit of the social aspect of educ
i can creat my own schedul and work when and where suit me best
i get to ask question and lectur ask me question to ensur i understand
i feel like thi is as close to activ learn as we can get in these time and have the teacher there and have them teach the class live i feel motiv me to actual go to class more and continu learn that i think i would have felt if i just had to watch some video lectur onlin whenev i want it wouldv exponenti my procrastin ad i probabl wouldnt have bother do it have the teacher send out zoom link that we were expect to be at help in keep my motiv somewhat up
i believ be abl to see my classmat and teacher help me pay attent the same way as if i were in a classroom
the lectur would explain slide in a lot more detail as they would dure a normal lectur or seminar oppos to give us powerpoint with minim detail on
i feel uncomfort in front of a camera
it help keep me account i have to show up allow for a minimum of interact between teacher and student too
can ask question if need
as it is explain better by the teacher becaus i can hear herhim speak

can go through in my own time and paus
you actual get taught the content
i can learn in my own time and when is conveni for me
it allow me to fulli engag with the materi be spoken to me if the info is ah hand to me via a piec of paper i think i don’t process the inform as well
there’ no distract of other student plu my lectur have been pretti great in their onlin vid and i feel total comfort to email them question if i have ani
i am abl to ask question and get immedi feedback
forc you to do it and attend
you get to interact with student and teacher in real time and learn from them in the closest situat to a classroom environ
i find it easier to take in inform when someon explain the concept to me i’m dyslex so i find it hard to retain inform which is just written flatli
live class are stress to me mostli becaus there are conduct in spanish in which im not fluent yet so it difficult to keep up sometim
can get respons asap
more engag and activ learn
it is more interact
i feel like i would be abl to actual ask my teacher question and have a real convers with them instead of just email as our school doesn’t allow zoom
you get to ask question as you go through the content
it’ more interact and fun i’m do veterinari so it’ nice that dure the practic time we can still watch peopl demonstr the practic live where we can instruct them what to do
it foster more discuss and interact with my teacher and peer

flexibl but explan and guidanc at the same time
can re wind and rewatch
it would be nice to talk to my teacher and get feedback from them
relat back to a school environ and you can ask the teacher question as they are explain topic so that you don’t have to go through a whole record class with not understand the materi
becaus you can alway ask for extra help then and there and they can answer ani question if you don’t understand also it feel more social and you’r abl to see other
it allow me to manag my own time
can be done in your own time can be done if wifi isn’t good enough for zoom
becaus i can paus the video and look thing up replay a part or play it quiker depen on my understand of the materi
the abil to bounc idea off one anoth
it is the most interact method
live class
interact with the teacher ask question
becaus one can interact with the professor
forc me to activ particip
you’r abl to ask question as it happen and it more like a ‘normal lesson’
i actual like when the lectur give a live class and record it i like the record becaus it great to watch back and paus the professor when they record the live class you also get to listen back to question peopl ask and respons they gave which can be hard to follow in the onlin way initi
i prefer a record video format where i can turn it on and off as i wish and i decid the pace of the learn process
i can ask question in real time
with a video i can learn at my own pace
the possibl of ask question exist
can do them ani time
becaus you can engag with the teacher
more interact and opportun to ask question much more engag also
still receiv fulli explain content
it’ almost like a real lectur powerpoint and lectur talk but can paus it so have as much time as need to make note
you can return to it when you want and manag your time better
i realli like upload and email materi as it give me the freedom to do my lesson whenev i want to do them in the week most of my content had been taught befor the lockdown so we are mainli do revis and as i revis independ anyway it seem logic to have email work and also do thi independ although i do feel a bit lone sometim and miss class banter which isn’t the same when we learn on team or on video call
it allow for engag we have record lectur and then live seminar for discuss
we can see each other face to face and it feel like we’r in a classroom
be a visual learner thi help me understand the content better
i am abl to write note alongsid the video paus it rewind feel as though i learn more that way than sit listen to the lectur live
we get to have actual interact with both our tutor and cours mate whilst obvious not be abl to receiv our proper educ it’ the best next thing
becaus it is the most interact one it is veri similar to be in class except you are not there it is easier to ask teacher question and you also feel less pressur to be formal then let’ say write an email you can also “chat” or let rather say u get more social interact that way
you can ask question instantan and it is more real
i went without live class for most of quarantin and start to loos purpos and motiv which led to a lack of disciplin after do a few debat onlin and listen to some explan from professor i’v realiz again whi i like my subject and that took my motiv back
i learn better when engag in discuss but it take me longer than the usual person to phrase my thought clearli so i prefer chat over live confer
you can find your own rithm
i actual have a combin of live and record lectur and i prefer thi combin becaus it realli help me that i can ask question dure the live lectur about the record one
thi wa the onli mode of teach for my onlin cours and i felt it wa the most interact way to do onlin teach zoom class felt the closest to actual real life lectur
record lectur allow me to go at my own pace skim when i understand everyth and pauserewind when someth is unclear it doesn’t assign a specif time time to work so i can studi when i learn best in the even hour
i need to be abl to interact with the lectur and ask question i cannot learn by simpli write off a powerpoint
you can ask your question just the way you could in normal class
i can understand the materi better when someon is talk rather when it onli written i can rewatch the lesson
interact with teacheroth student
i like the freedom of choos when i want to studi i love to be abl to see all that im excpect to learn in my cours at one glanc i can plan my studi in advanc
i like the fact that i can activ use my knowledg in a projectassing of some kind so im actual forc to stretch my brain instead of just passiv listen to a lectur or seminar it veri easi to get distract in the live class there onli one option but i also prefer record lectur to live one becaus it easier to take note i can take break and no one ever ask question in the live one anyway
go through content at our own time and pace but still get teacher support
easier to understand face to face but i can still manag time easili
can watch at ani time and can paus and rewind to realli understand
usual the time arent good
you can ask question and have a discuss
it offer dynam lesson and establish a routin which for me is benefici dure quarantin
interact
abil to get feedback in real time
you can work at your own pace and paus the video if you want to make more note
our univers use a combin of live session which i couldnt attend becaus i wa ill record lesson and uploadedemail resourc record lectur have a simmilar feel to live class as the professor is abl to explain the materi at far more depth than just through powerpointsword document but i could still ask question via emailforum on bright pace
closest thing to the actual class
it allow you to revisit what wa said by teacher as a mean of revis
you can ask question live and have them answer live it feel the most like a normal lesson
i find inform easier to understand when explain by someon
becaus i can watch the lectur when i want
i can paus it and make more note
the most engag closest thing to activ learn so i concentr the most
i can interact with the lectur and other student allow for 2 way commun these session should also be record for student who cant be at the live session
i’m an aural learner and realli reli on the nonverb cue of a live session to be abl to fulli understand a concept i also onli rememb thing after i’v discuss them and a record complet take that away
it allow me to interact with my teacher and fellow student in a much more structur way and it imit the classroom environ as well i find thi help me with my confid as well as my focu
flexibl in schedul and due date
it’ easier and don’t have to talk to everyon virtual live
becaus it’ the closest thing to the real class
it allow me to be more flexibl in my schedul as i dont have time tabl around onlin class
i can actual interact with the teacher and ask my question face to face and it is easili to understand when concept are explain verbal
have onli experienc thi mode would howev like to be given other mode
i can work through it at my own speed
do the work at your own pace learn what you need to know and not what you don’t
it give me time to stop and absorb the content i can go at my own pace read around a certain topic ectnon of the anxieti that come with be live
it is similar to teach at school
allow it to be done in own time
visual realli help me learn and rememb thing
you can ask question dure the lectur you dont have to wait hour or day for your professor repli
so i can paus it and take good note
it encourag activ think and particip
i love the abil to still engag with the professor and other student
becaus it feel live and real
you can work at your own pace when you want to
i can go at my own pace
allow me to work at my own pace
it keep you motiv and allow for more interact
i can ask question while a teacher is teach
i can selfstudi best thi way
would prefer a mixtur of live class and upload materi but live class mean more interact and less ambigu when it come to work set
you can connect with peopl fulli and peopl are more will to share and encourag one anoth i suppos it is more like how class would be at uni
it’ the most similar to the regular teach
becaus i can rewatch the record as mani time as i want
i can paus and go back if i get distract or dont understand someth if i have doubt at the end of the class i can contact my professor about it
more engag interest i’m less like to put it off feel more like i’m in an inperson lectur sinc it’ in real time
i can focu better on the materi
i feel like there are mani interrupt when it come to live class and record lectur aren’t interact wherea discuss forum are and i person prefer them
becaus you are abl to ask the teacher question about the lectur inmedi and other student mayb have the same question and also you can ask the teacher to repeat it in other way that with upload note you cant or it more difficult via email
we are given suffici instruct and are abl to work through our assign at our own pace
besid be more motiv than the rest os the method a live class end up be veri similar to presenti one and it help listen to the class doubt and discuss
it is the most interact and so easiest for me to focu over the whole of the lesson anyth prerecord or without actual speech from teacher and pupil mean i lose concentr veri quickli and i struggl to teach myself the materi
more interact
it feel normalish more fun interact
we can realli contribut and do as if we were actual in a kind of classroom
becaus we can ask question and particip in discuss
can ask question and get an immedi respons and clearer understand than just read materi sent through email
by ask question directli it help a lot hear the voic actual speak howev it is realli hard to concentr and stay in the zone
more engag
veri similar to a school environ and make me feel as if my day is still structur as call have to take place at specif time
becaus you actual interact with your teacher
you have to do your work at a certain time and cannot procrastin it becaus it is live
easi to access and can be done anywhereanytim
becaus it give us a space to work on problem in breakout group which isnt alway possibl in a larg lectur theatr
i prefer be a clear verbal explan from s teacher but i do not enjoy live class becaus of anxieti
you can ask question in real time and ask the teacher to go slower or faster etc it most similar to face to face learn
becaus i receiv lectur materi i make some preparationread materi research some moment in detail then i watch the lectur where teacher may focu my attent at some key moment and also it’ way of learn inform for long term
easier to understand and it feel more like be in a physic classroom
you can get answer to your question in real time
no awkward interact in live class and more in depth understand then upload assign materi
i enjoy and deepli valu the opportun to talk with and learn from my peer and teacher in real time
can creat my own schedul and pausereplay to fulli understand concept
face to face teach is a lot easier when tri to understand materi as to be abl to have someon explain thing verbal on the spot and clarifi thing that you don’t understand or are learn for the first time definit help
becaus i work best when i focu on one subject for a longer time and the onlin class are spread over the day with gap of half an hour and stuff which make it harder to focu and get the work done
as effici and flexibl as upload materi is i miss hear people’ voic and interact in discuss
idk
noth replac face to face learn
you can watch them at anytim
i don’t have to go through as much anxieti
you can ask ani quation about the materi and they can help you directli to understand the topic
i found the absenc of everyday contact terribl and dure live class i would sens a bit of normal howev i did not mind the upload mmateriali achiv more and i could manag my time better too
more interact so requir me to have done prepar and be readi to askansw question also abl to here opinion of other student as well as lectur
becaus it impos a routin someth that can be super messi when studi onlin
i can paus it and look into my textbook
becaus i can relisten the lectur
i get to speak to the teacher and hear my friend too
the oblig to attend
feel the most ‘involved’ and similar to face to face teach
real time interact with the prof be abl to ask question and get an instant answer
interact is key for learn
interact forc me to attend
my teacher cannot afford to record lectur or video discuss form arent usual help becaus student are primarili dormant and email materi arent either india ha a weird way of teach it studentsit usual memor and noth els so live interact is better becaus the 1 of the class that actual pay attent could interact with the teacher
i feel part of the classroom and abl to discuss better with other student
becaus it is the one that work most of my teacher struggl with live classesvideosetc
have face to face contact with peopl
it feel more like normal univers lectur
more interact
interact can ask question feel most like a normal face to face lesson
never experienc the other
my cours is realli practic so we did a lot of theori i’m a visual learner and thi allow me to go at my own pace
my time manag ha been realli bad be abl to check the content anytim would be realli use
we get to interact with our teacher and ask question when need with an immedi respons
most support
becaus it’ simpl and when it’ done i can go do other thing
i can do it at my own pace
i prefer read inform
it is more benefici
give me time to complet the work and understand thing at my own pace
feel of a real class without the pressur of it be live
can do at own pace
i can do it in my own pace
more interact
i some time struggl be abl to get the record lectur up
becaus especi sinc we are quit a small class we can all ask question if we don’t understand someth and i find it to be a veri straightforward method of teach
becaus i can appli what i learn
i can studi on my own time
more interact and get to hearse your friend and teacher
best simul in person teach that i’m use to
more flexibl and can do anywher anytim
i don’t have to wast my time on a live chat and can get on with my work asap
live lesson are more motiv and forc you to interact and engag with the task at hand wherea upload task with a due date is often put off until the last minut and time is wast
most interact easi to ask question
becaus it would be easier to ask a question or interact with the content
model synchron classroom learn on a digit platform
i learn better when thing are explain to me by someon speak
you are abl to receiv instant verbal feedback as well as ask question you are onli given the amount of work that would take place in an hour help bring more structur to my day
it’ more interact
it is real time interact
more interact way of studi engag with content and teacher
we can ask question still
it easier to ask question and the teacher make it more clear but i also like it with upload media becaus you dont forget anyth so mayb a mix would be great
abl to discuss and ask question straight away
i can choos when i can watch it and can look at it again when studi for an exam
i can rewatch anyth i don’t understand and can watch at my own speed
i can stop the video and revisit the topic whenev i feel the need to
caus i think it’ the mode that look the most like the normal cours in high school
i’m a visual learner and the small number of record lesson i have had to watch are mainli auditori
i can work through it in my own time it is way less pressuris
view on prefer time abil to stop and go back when someth is unclear
becaus it feel like the teacher is teach you but it’ actual more flexibl for us student as we can watch the video anytim
you can play them at ani speed and look back at them for further use
i can check my understand to make sure i’v grasp the concept i made note on
record lectur
better interact
interact motiv
can ask question with immedi respons and input from other student
becaus you do not have ani difficulti regard time zone or when one’ internet is slow you can break up record lectur and fit them a lot better into your daili routin
more interact and feel more like normal
becaus yo get to be an activ member of the class you can ask thing and get answer back at the moment and i think it’ a more interact way
i can work at my own pace and time and it forc me to realli engag with the subject
it is much easier to have someth explain to you and you feel so much more connect to your teacher and class mate
interact more engag
i feel like i can ask more question and gain more understand with a lot more exampl
it feel like live teach but without the awkward tension of zoom meet i also realli like be abl to keep the video and a resourc and start and stop the video as i need to make the best note possibl
it allow me to work at my own pace and build my own person timet rather than my day be restrict to whatev time my onlin lectur might be
can watch the video back as mani time as need
easiest
becaus you are intact with your teacher and classmat
i have ‘phone anxiety’ so onlin particip is nerv rack
i can paus and look back
record video and record for sure
becaus it make studi an interact experi and emul a normal ‘seminar’
allow for a mix of lectur and interact
it is more person and it is the closest to be with the teacher in class also better way of learn and easier commun if need
interact with the lectur and verbal explan on topic motiv to get up in time for the lectur
i can do the work when i want to do it
we could take note from powerpoint while hear the teacher give the lectur at our own pace and could go back contrarili to live class and email the teacher if we had ani question it wa simpl and not timespecif mean that i could work a fulltim job at the same time and not miss ani class
interact
i think it is the most product way to use the alloc to time for teach becaus as student we can actual discuss the work with our teacher and fellow student
permit activ and involv learn from both written sourc and classmatesteach alongsid the emot benefit of spend time albeit onlin with other
i can do thing in my own time
record discuss
it’ a great way to be abl to ask ani question about work set and ani confus that you may have it can sometim be difficult to understand what a teacher is tri to say simpli through messag so speak on a zoom call for exampl enabl further clariti it also creat a better learn environ and a sens of commun in a time which can be veri isol see the face of school friend and recreat a classroom atmospher as much as possibl is benefici for maintain a posit learn environ in comparison to one which is lone where work could start to feel overwhelm
it is more practic sinc i can take my time when take note and understand the materi with my own pace of understand
interact and abil to ask question and receiv an answer as you go
as i am abl to work at my own pace and not have to worri about have to be at a class by a certain time and onli have due date to keep on top of
becaus i like kinda teach myself all thi stuff
it’ similar to that of a tradit lectur
more flexibl choic of what day you do it how much time you spend on it
as it is easier to get help due to the live natur of the class you can easili be talk through thing as well as work independ by use upload materi
i understand more
thi way i can talk to my teacher and ask question
abl to engag easili with teacher
it is the closest to sit in the actual class
becaus it help me understand the content better and i can ask my teacher for help when i don‘t understand someth rather than have to learn the content by myself
most similar to teach in classroom but no time requir unlik zoom etc
it the most similar to actual school tri to teach yourself a level further math and physic is realli hard
it allow me to ask straight away and get real feedback
interact
they work better becaus the internet connect can be too unstabl for call but it better than read
i am abl to focu more and there is no temptat to just switch it off and becom unfocus becaus you’r have to be activ involv
it most close resembl inperson seminar as can actual talk through my idea the chat room seminar take so long for the tutor to repli and i find them exhaust and unproduct
feel more like a real lesson
becaus dure live lesson you can directli commun with the teacher
live class
it’ more similar to actual in person lectur and is more engag
more support avail
i can schedul my time around it and am abl to paus the video to take note make sure i don’t miss import detail
so i can interact with teacher and student
i am an auditori learner
i can rewatch difficult concept multipl time
greater abil to understand lectur inform
structur your own day also can paus video vs live where if your internet cut etc you miss lesson
we get to interact with teacher and friend and it more motiv than sit complet alon
interact and sociabl
help student engag more in what their learn
effici
it possibl to ask question
more help and effici
im more like to attend these than to listen to prerecord materi more interact realli not that differ from actual lectur
actual face to face learn
becaus you can ask your teacher in the moment when you have a problem and not have to wait until hesh respond to your mail
i find live teach much more interact and engag i also find it more pressur in a good way than prerecord lectur so i am more focus
i can still achiev some level of good commun with tutor over video call
becaus it the closest thing to be there in person you can see peopl facial express and hear their voic instead of just look at word on a screen that make a realli big differ for me becaus i and probabl everyon els thrive better in my educ when i feel connect to other peopl i also feel like thi is the most activ and engag mode becaus i feel more oblig to particip than if the class is just be taught through eg googl doc becaus i feel more account
for me live class are a lot more engag a can be more interact than record materi it make me feel more motiv and encourag me to take part and keep up with my studi
easier to commun can ask lectur question at ani moment inform
abl to ask questionsseek support
it give me an opportun to take in the inform at a time that work for me and give me time to think over the inform as i read or see it i can also look back on video if there are point ive miss
it seem more like an actual lesson with your teacher so it increas my motiv
anxieti disord
more interact forc me to be more disciplin
contribut and have direct feedback
it easier to ask question and content of the lesson are better explain
becaus it alway you to engag with your instructor ask question whenev you want and it set off a routin just like ani other normal day
you can do it whenev you want you can paus it and rewatch it
it ha more freedom in term of my day it’ frustrat to lose so much if you miss a day of class i didn’t have mani zoom etc class but it wa veri annoy when i had to i couldn’t pay attent or retain much inform
the content be taught is easier to retain as it is a much more interact engag tool than record lectur etc
make you actual do the work
becaus you can still interact with your professor and fellow student
more interact and most like normal
that would be much easier for the intern studentsmyself be one caus of the time differ and most importantli the internet acess is veri poor at time
interact account abl to ask question
i can work more effic
interact instant feedback and answer to question
be abl to digest the materi present at my own pace
direct commun with teacher and student feel the most like class
becaus the live lesson dont work properli and email have no guidanc and stress me out
keep me account to attend class and particip
they help provid a use summari and overview of the topic that is be cover and i find it a good springboard for my own thought onlin class are also good although the size of my class might inhibit overal particip and make them less effect
more person

most interact love see and talk to my friend and teacher
i prefer to work through the materi at my own pace with some music or snack
it is more like school
can watch at my own pace when i want
you can paus the lectur to take notesdo your own research while still take part in the class
easier for time manag
activ learn particip
you have to site there at a specif time
easi to follow
i can rewatch as mani time as i need
as a deaf student i find it hard to have live session or record lectur without ani subtitl or transcript there fore i prefer upload materi as there is not speech or audio requir
can do when i want
with live class there is more possibl for interact between the student and the teacher and it make it easier to ask explain question
becaus it allow ask question as well as be forc to fit it in your schedul so you actual attend
it allow me to interact more with the teacher and stay focus
it allow for a much more ‘classroomlike’ experi and it make it much easier to ask question and understand materi
more human and real and make it feel like how it did in colleg

i can stop paus and go at my own speed
it is more engag email materi are not activ enough for me
easi to follow and includ all info
freedom to ask question at the time with the teacher abl to discuss in detail
i find it is the most interest and i get the most inform out of the time
i have found it the onli method that truli let me learn at my own pace be that faster or slower than the other
you are abl to ask other peer question and discuss the topic that’ be taught
i can take my own time and paus or skip if i want to
can do it whenev i want
you can paus them and take note and go back and rewatch them to understand the content better
can easili rewatch content
i can do it when i prefer and replay the part that i want basic freedom
most similar to normal
becaus it’ the most similar to be in the actual lesson the teacher can explain thing etc
can go on my own pace
i like to manag my time on my own sometim i feel like im lose time dure the compulsori onlin lesson useless some of them
live class give me the chanc to interact with other sutdent
it allow me to work independ i have all the materi i need to complet the task and i can go back to revis it at ani time
it’ more like be in a real classroom
the closest option to real life class
all the relev inform wa provid and audio made it feel like the actual lectur as much as it could
it easier to understand and we can watchlisten to the materi sever time
i can ask question directli to my professor as we go over the materi
it’ a lot easier to understand certain topic which are new subject in learn
still like lectur but easier to interact
i havent experienc anyth differ yet
i can fast forward watch it at my own pace and have more flexibl in plan out my day
in the current situación internet is not work so well so a record class is easi to understand and you can ask later to the professor
i like the social aspect of sit in a class and discuss materi
easier and simpler
i may follow the lectur whenev i want to
it is more interact
i think it would be better and easier to commun and discuss
auditori learner
more interact
it better to have the possibl to engag with the teacher and everyth is clearer
it is the closest altern to my regular class hour eg seminar i feel more engag and i have a set timet to keep to
possibl of direct interact
easi to ask question
better engag more accountabilitymotiv
abil to replay certain part i studi math so thi is especi use for proof
lockdown onli affect the last two month of my cours so i knew what i wa work on and onli need some addit inform to carri on work on thi if we had a lot of content left to cover then i would of need live teach like zoom call but my cours is mainli assign base so easi to get on with quit independ
you can receiv first hand feedback and it’ more interact which i find easier to learn in environ like that
can interact with the lectur
easi to access and includ all the inform for that class
i can prioritis certain subject and do the work when i feel is best as oppos to be restrict by a timet
teacherstud interact is absolut essenti and help guid student toward a more effici and profit studi method
becaus the teacher is abl to explain the content and we can ask question directli
better interact
some teacher give clearer instruct that are more thorough
to work on my own pace and it’ easier
you can ask question discuss as a class and it just feel a bit more normal so stop me from go crazi just do work by myself all day
you can ask question and you have a routin everi day
can easili ask question if you don’t understand someth
becaus you can plan yourself when you want to follow the class but we also have workgroup in which we discuss the materi more thorough
more benefici
much more interact than record lectur
i heard that student have more connect out of it
for my subject i just requir somewher to check in with my teacher about my progress not for actual teach
i like complet the materi at my own speed and i find live class veri stress
becaus i feel like you cab interact more and also are abl to get more help
i am still abl to have that engag of discuss with my peer and learn togeth as i would at school rather than independ work that i wa set through email resourc the latter did not motiv me to work and i found it more difficult to understand work independ
more interact and can appli knowledg
i find it easier to interact with the content when i can see the lectur
it’ independ and i can work through it when and how i do best
im not realli good at work with videosl chat becaus i get tire fast and my eye hurt im better in work with materi on paper
live teach allow you to get into a routin
i think that thi make the class the most interact and provid live feedback
it’ more interact and you can ask question in real time
can access in your own time but option to contact your professor is still possibl
engag in class account abil to ask question in real time
you can take your learn at your own pace
anxieti over googl meet most effici way to get work done
can easili pauseskip throughspe upslow down to tailor to my own note take
it the closest to what lesson are like in real life
i like thing be explain to me without the pressur of have to answer live
i find that i can concentr on a zoom call and that i work much better do class in my own time without the pressur of be on a call
allow for flexibl within your scheduletim and it is still engag compar to upload materi
our teach consist of post on forum and then discuss further on the live chat and thi wa a realli good way of properli discuss idea we’d had and problem we’d dealt with with other member of the class that wasn’t in our forum and the lectur themselv it’ a much more organ way of learn and veri similar to the seminar structur we had precovid just onlin
i miss a lot of materi dure live lectur so have the opportun to go through the slide and record audio for each slide allow me to learn in my own time
much more interact and similar to what were use to in class
free to do in our own time yet still contain all content live lectur do
i need to be taught the content in order to absorb it sometim the teacher also teach us extra thing
can work through them at your own pace
it allow me to have direct contact with the professor
more engag allow you to still particip and connect with peopl
i can do it in my own time at my own pace without worri about be pick on to answer question
my teacher dont use the other mode so i dont know what they are like
i can go back and revisit info i could have miss first time
interact more like a real lectur
easi for music lesson as they are veri practic
i learn better when i listen to the lectur from the professor
i don’t enjoy self studi so have a teacher explain certain topic realli help me in understand the work better
abil to paus make own note and have freedom to work when i’m in the right mood rather than forc myself into a zoom call at a particular time and absorb liter no info
you can do the work at your own pace but the option is there to request help if you need it
i find it difficult to be product at specif time’ when learn from home so i believ that record lectur allow you to work when the individu is at their most product and subsequ produc the best work they can thi also help to reduc to pressur and stress put on student especi at thi time
it’ a lot easier to understand when the teacher is talk and you can see them
i like to be abl to feel like i’m in a classroom even if i’m at home i’m more like to ask question when on a live meet than when an assign is just sent to us without convers about it
becaus i can do it whenev i want and after three onlin video class im veri tire my head hurt and my vision get wors
becaus i can organis my schedul and go back to ani class if need
the record lectur were never upload at the time of the lectur so my schedul disappear straight away which made it hard to do the work zoom lectur would be at a certain time and more interact
allow you to get more detail inform about the concept and make you feel as if you are still at school
can see everyon
becaus it make us have more oneonon contact with teacher
i person engag realli well with research task and i learn most when do them live confer can be use but also intimid
most interact
explain better so i can understand content more
interact with studentsprofessor
feel more confid comfort ask question
becaus it enabl me to see what the other are think about the topic and becaus i get to interact with my classmat while be at eas
it easi to use
can commun as close to face to face as possibl
interact teach provid all the import social part of educ that record lectur can’t
more detail than upload work and feel more realist but can also do it whenev i want to
easier to follow
it allow us to understand the content much better
my internet is not good enough for a live class to be done properli moreov my onlin class are with the camera off and mic of and question are ask in the chat henc it is veri imperson and not worth it upload materi are not good enough for me to actual understand if ai could learn thi way i would just googl instead of pay tuition thu mayb record lectur are not great but at least i can rewatch them and teacher usual explain themselv better if speak instead of write
becaus it make me assist when i am suppos to i think it would be harder to do record class sinc i’v never been under thi mode
team
i feel it is the most interact method and make it easi to rais question if necessari
becaus i can paus take note and take my time to understand fulli what ha been sayd instead of rush and not focus
easi to keep up with and can be done at your own speed
it allow for better explan but you can also work at your own pace i struggl to sit for long period due to chronic pain
you’r free to access it when you actual want to work rather than sit in front of your comput half asleep at a 730 lectur
i’m more like to be fulli present and engag in the class if i am directli look at my teacher
i realli feel i need the interact the face to face and proper commun make studi feel so much more normal and control and the content just goe in
i can work on my own term and wont get bore
lectur can go into detail and explain their lectur slide which can be paus and gone back over again and again
closest to real life
record lectur
becaus it feel the most like normal school and i engag and concentr more in them
can paus at ani time watch them at ani time speed them upslow them down
you can ask question directli and get a quick respons
more interact and forc everyon to do it at the exact time
there are less interrupt and i can watch the record at ani time in ani posit it’ more comfort
becaus you can go at your own pace through the materi
becaus if i have a question dure class i can get an answer quickli from my teacher instead of wait for a respons to an email
abl to ask question
it’ much more interact and it forc me to attend the class otherwis i wouldn’t have work as much
becaus i can go back and rewatch them and so get more out of it
face to face teach is so import and i believ it wa the english poet coleridg who onc said “teach is better discussed”
you can particip as you choos and receiv feedbackexplan easili
i don’t feel comfort with live call but would like to be taught physic
i don’t have to studi at a particular time which make my day more flexibl
the most similar to how it ha alway been
more interact
it is the easiest way to interact with and learn from other student input discuss forum and chat are great as well but talk is easier and faster
you can complet activ in your own time
i am a languag student and it easier for us to practic and debat in class
i can take my time to understand the materi
feel face to face direct
i get to do everyth on my own that mean that im done a lot quicker i also dont have to listen to anyth that i alreadi know so i work way more effici
it’ more dynam
onlin class gave some structur to the day also ad a social aspect wherea be send in endless amount of practic question to complet felt useless we can find our own practic question
it give me time to stop and think about what i’m learn i can spend as much or as littl time i want on a subject
it more engag and motiv
you can ask question
becaus you can easili ask your teacher someth
i can paus and rewind i get all the inform a professor would give in class
more interact
it is similar to be in the classroom with the fact that you are learn directli from your teacher but it allow for flexibl within your person schedul due to it be record
live class give me anxieti so i prefer alreadi record materi
handi enough also like post materi can work through it in your own time
becaus it’ more interact and make me more account for my learn we were given prerecord lectur from the year befor so i wasn’t as focus on do it as i should’v been
i can learn at my own time and at my own pace with the luxuri if somebodi explain my work
it is the closest you get to actual have a teacher there in a lesson
i find it extrem differ to studi with a teacher commentari and support than without it lectur are nonnegoti and im glad we can continu the teacherstud engag live studi by yourself and teach yourself alon is way differ and it doesnt get the same result
can access it at ani time and can come back to it
more interact
caus it give me oppurtun to schedul my day as i want
becaus it feel like a convers rather than learn everyth by myself
access at ani time can paus and rewind
beacus i actual listen to my professor and i can ask question if i dont understand someth also i hate recor lesson becaus i procrastin on them and i dont listen to them regularli
i can take my time and paus the video if i need to i like the live class for human interact though
it easi to discuss more complex and unfamiliar topic and get answer from the instructor right away if you dont understand someth
more interact
more interact and it’ live with the lectur instead of it be prerecord
you can still interact with your class mate and teacher a more activ form of learn
becaus it allow me to access the inform at a time that work for me sinc at home i have more respons which have chang my work schedul
resembl inperson teach the most and can ask question at the time
becaus you can ask question in real time and actual have a discuss with the other peopl in your class
you can engag with the teacher more and it feel more like be in a real supervis
it give me structur and interact i live on my own and need to get myself product and social
you are abl to engag with other peopl instead of just stare into a screen
i can manag my time better
becaus the teacher can discuss the complet topic and we can watch later on our own time from what we have learnt from the video we can ask question
you can do it in your own time
i like to have as much direct contact with my teacher and classmat as possibl
back and fore qa
it feel like i’m still in a class room and i can still paus the video if i miss someth or a key aspect which is veri import for my note take i also i can re watch it anytim which is also amaz
becaus it is the one which most resembl a real class
i can work at my own pace without wait for other to catch up
as it is as if i’m back at school
can be abl to interact
more space for interact and understand of the subject
it’ almost the same as live lectur but you can paus the video whenev you want

i find it intimid to not have the support of my peer when answer as i feel as though it’ more embarrass if i get an answer wrong
more flexibl
becaus it is almost like lesson at school you see the teacher he or she ha a powerpoint and you can ask question
there is engag so you’d be abl to take stuff in and learn someth and ask ani question you might have
i prefer to learn in my own time and i can emailus a forum to ask about ani question i have about the materi
becaus it’ easi to access at ani time and find the inform i need at my own pace
becaus i can better manag my studi
i feel more comfort email tutor rather than video call
it allow a greater understand due to be abl to ask question
zoom or microsoft team thi are the one there i use more frequent are tool that make possibl the direct or live contact with the teacher and facilit the engag with anoth student

not face to face but can still contact the teacher and classmat
i can watch at my own pace and at the time it suit me
can watch in your own time
i think that the point of educ is to discuss materi analys it togeth have a convers and thi way you learn better
i learn best when there is some form of structur to it cours be complet self direct and continu primarili through read is prove challeng especi when consid deterior mental health in lockdown and the need to self motiv at a vital point in my educ in a time where realli i just want to stay in bed and watch netflix
abl to look back at the materi in case you couldnt attend the lectur and better than a record where you have to listen to 1hour lectur for that last 5min of inform you were look for
someth is happen live so you are requir to attend it at that time
i feel more independ that way and can be more product
can actual clear the doubt more effect
more familiar and you still get qualiti teach
can interact with the teacher directli
i can go back and rewind someth i miss
becaus you can actual talk to peopl in real time not just write email best would be all of them combin eg live class which would be record if i could get materi befor live class where all student would have a discuss

easier to do work whenev you get rime and upload it befor due date
becaus you can work through it independ

befor the coronaviru my lectur also consist of mainli passiv listen write note sinc we are 700 i don’t like the live class becaus then i’m oblig to watch the class on a certain hour

easier to choos when to watch

more engag more similar to actual be at uni
you can get live interact know everyon is do the lesson at the same time
spoken inform less confus and can be explain
direct interact with lectur
at thi level ma discuss aren’t vital for the think process and it is where i get most new insight
i am not an audio learner
can pausego back and write detail note and it alway there so you don’t have to do it straight away
it is difficult to understand scientif concept through materi sent to us and messag onli
less awkward and can attain more inform
easier to ask question if they come about and see other question which student may have ask
better to engag with and do in your own time
help me stay up to date with my lectur and enabl discuss
you can complet the materi in your own time you can also rewatch record lectur or go back over certain part that you didn’t understand
can more easili ask question
the work can still be complet independ and in your own time but mean the teacher deliv the content in pretti much the same way they would have done precovid person i would prefer it over live class as it mean you don’t have to sit through stuff you’r alreadi confid on and can progress quicker
it motiv me to follow the lesson
question can be answer more quickli and effeci
as i know for sure it will work live lectur are so depend on the lectur internet connect and those have not alway been good
you can do it wheneverwherev you need to and don’t have to worri about be on time so it’ much more flexibl also there’ not the problem of video call judg of hous etc
more motiv and most like actual school it mean that i have some type of forc routin which forc me to work
i can do everyth at my own pace and i can arrang my day as i find more conveni we also have live tutor through googl meet and it’ veri help
it the closest thing we have to actual face to face contact time with tutor right now so i feel it the most effect method

it interact and you feel more motiv and less alon do the work
becaus it is easi to ask question straightaway and it is more similar to inperson lectur therefor it is more familiar and easier to make note as im use to do
it give me a chanc to look at the materi in my own time without have to come onlin for a class
it help to minim wast time
i thrive on person interact and it also forc me to devot a specif time to learnung
email materi often contain too littl inform which is difficult to understand on your own with live class we get an opportun to ask more question express our opinion and begin a discuss
it allow me to work through at my own pace
easi to do at your own speed in your own time
easier to understand materi human subject discuss is essenti
more engag and you can be held account while on camera instead of get distract by the tv
so i can watch it faster and learn at the pace i like
can work at own pace good revis zoom call with teacher can be stress and hard to keep up with
keep you focus keep you account replic the classroom environ as much as possibl
you can ask your teacher question directli they respond by talk and it can be more precis
activ engag with other
feel most like a normal class and can interact directli immedi with class mate and instructor
becaus it like be in class but you can paus video to take note
it is more person and there it is more interact
thi would be my prefer mode of onlin teach becaus it simul the real teach situat the best you still are tie to a schedul and you cant replay part of the lectur you miss becaus you werent pay attent i think thi is a good thing becaus with the record lectur i tend to replay everi bit i miss so the lectur take way more time and brain power also with the record lectur it harder to have a schedul becaus the teacher do not upload consist
i can adapt the content to my desir speed paus is possibl but it is not onli go through book the professor is actual talk which is quit nice
provid some structur
it is easier to complet and organis
it easier rather than tri to have 150 peopl into one class
ask question from professor is easier and the live class feel the most same as normal contact studi would feel
becaus i can paus the lectur ani time and if i have ani question i can email my teacher
becaus i can learn better with thi and it’ mir interact
becaus you can interract with the teacher
sometim when internet is not work correctli i miss someth someon is say in a live class my teacher don’t record their live class
flexibl to learn materi at own time
it’ more interact and give me a chanc to ask question
it allow me to pauserewind lectur so i can take more comprehens note
i can choos when to watch the lesson
becaus i feel like i am actual be taught the content and can therefor engag in it rather than teach myself with onlin materi
it more interact provid a set time do the work keep up social interact easier to learn
video allow me to paus at anytim i want i can therefor be more consciou of what im take note of if i dont understand someth i can replay the part as much as i want also sinc it record i can alway look back at it if i later realis that ive forgotten someth
i can do it in my own time but it is still slightli interact
you would be abl to interact with your teacher
i can interact with my teacher and classmat
as for me materi are the most signific help that my teacher can provid to me as a student becaus i have the internet and i am abl to find some lectur and video by myself
provid more structur and feel a lot more like school
i’m abl to work at my own pace
i can schedul my time on my own and prepar myself individuali for my exam
you can ask the teacher question as they are teach the content
it becom strenuou and hard to manag an onlin discuss with the organ of my school’ system i find that when we tri onlin discuss on a zoom call or forum as a class most peopl do not want to particip or do not have the incent to contribut becaus of thi i prefer independ structur my lesson my teacher give us an option to go to “offic hours” but they onli make me more anxiou i tend to find i work better when i can just control myself and work at my own pace use given resourc
so i can do univers at time the suit me dure thi time
i think that thi mode allow student the closest thing to inperson class convers can flow more natur
i can manag my time how i want as long as i meet the deadlin
as someon with social anxieti record lectur i can get done on my own pace sound a lot more appeal than have to be in a live call with a professor and other student
more focusedact
easi to understand
i can ask question to the teacher there and then
it the closest we can get to actual discuss in person
i enjoy the abil to rewind video to take better note or to rewatch a part i didn’t quit understand
no commit to a specif time and no chanc of be call on unexpectedli
can access it whenev i want and wa abl to bing my lectur to get ahead give me more revis time
becaus record can be paus replay sped up slow down and you can skip irrelev bit
it allow realtim engag
it allow me to get on with the work in my own time while know that my teacher are onlin if i need help
live class aren’t as effici as they typic would be in a classroom set for a lot of teacher so give us the work and clear instruct work a lot better for me
more interact

contact with professor ask question immedi when theyr come to my mind
i can do thi in my own time
it’ easier to commun directli with the teacher
becaus i have experienc onli live class and email materi thu i prefer live class as the teach materi is actual be explain
keep me attent dure lesson
i am abl to learn at my own pace
i feel that it is the best use of time avail
it allow for learn to be activ which is the whole point
less pressur to answer
lectur can give a bit more detail for their explan rather than just the content on powerpoint slide
becaus i can paus it and write note
my cours requir convers and discuss which email or live chat don’t realli allow for as well
googl meet are a bit tire
it more flexibl
more engag and similar to an in person lectur
becaus i feel like thi is the best way to realli learn someth and look at it with differ view
paus and take note while take do the lectur
can paus and rewind when need
i can learn at my own pace
you can skip forward and backward to go over part you don’t understand
becaus you have the freedom of time yet you are still get some form of face to face teqch

everyth is alway access
make me motiv to actual attend class rather than when thing are record i don’t feel motiv on my own term to do it
i‘m not studi alon
allow me to review inform given at a later date
i prefer to work at my own pace and i get more work done
it give the possibl to studi at your own speed
it requir activ engag in the materi
live class with discuss
it’ the closest thing to an inperson class
i can access it at ani time of the day and can choos how i structur my day as the content is prerecord
i can do the work in my own time but i still know the teacher will mark and interact with my work
becaus i dont learn much by listen and i love my freedom and organ when it come to studi
i am more of a visual learner so it help to see the concept be work through i also like be abl to do it on my own time
it give the best opportun for discuss about the subject

i work at my own pace
easiest

no pressur when use the softwar
it attempt to mimic the interact that we have with teacher in regular school as one is forc to concentr in class becaus one might be ask question i find it is more effect than simpli upload assign where one can be much more easili distract

easier for the teacher to explain complic content and easier interact

becaus i can make my own schedul and also becaus ill be abl to return and watch the lectur again if i didnt understand someth the first time
i get nervou and prefer the independ
in combin with live class i believ it provid student with an opportun to voic their opinion and also exchang idea not onli with professor but also with fellow student
becaus it seem like im actual still in class talk to real peopl
it kind of forc you to be present and pay attent for 12 hour rather than get an email say “read chapter 3” and then never end up read at all
clearer

i can do everyth on my own time
becaus if you have ani problem you can ask the teacher directli and can move on to the next part of your lessonexercis without wait a day or two

becaus it allow you to freeli interact with your classmat and teacher whilst provid that realtim teach which resembl a normal classroom set better thi make student feel less isol and more comfort
you can plan your time more flexibl but i think it’ best when there is a zoom lectur each week for question
more interact than the record one
it would be just like sit in school and learn and that’ i think the best way for my particular cours becaus the lectur reli so much on the teacher explain scenario and strategi in context
put less pressur on have to do live work and can keep to your own timet
it’ the mode that allow for the most interact with the teacher and within student
allow you to understand stuff on your own with video class i get easili distract and struggl to concentr on what’ happen so i often miss import inform
allow for more engag as with record lectur you cant ask question or you lose focu
i can watch lectur back whenev it is conveni for me and if i forget anyth they’r good for revis and less tediou than look through a forum or read the materi the live lectur i would normal have are for 250 peopl so interact wa limit anyway which is whi i chose record lectur
it’ possibl to discuss with the techer and classmat
more interact

becaus it feel most similar to regular univers day
still abl to get a lectur as in the instructor actual teach the topic
more engag but doe not feel as pressuris
idk
it is my prefer mode becaus i can interact and learn in a more construct manner down to the fact that i am physic speak and engag with my teacher and classmat
becaus it is easier to interact it make the class more interact and interest
question are easi to ask and can be explain as if you are there in person you can also commun with the whole class which can be use for get other opinion
becaus they are interact
i like interact with teacher
it is interact but without the pressur of be live
more interact more similar to ‘normal’ inperson schoolclassroom environ
more intim give more opportun to ask tutor question if someth is not understood
it make me feel at least a littl pressur that motiv me to do anyth
have lecturesseminar record allow for them to be more flexibl timewis as sometim it is difficult to be abl to dedic an hour dure the day for a set lectur when work condit at home won’t allow it
greatest amount of inform can be convey
i can work through the materi at a more comfort pace
more peopl to actual do the work in live class instead of option work upload by teacher it also give the opportun to ask the teacher ani question without have to wait for an email repli
i can paus and go back to understand the video
abil to directli ask question forc me to do the work at a certain time

the lectur can expand on note written in their powerpoint
easier to engag and closer to the inperson experi i am use to
more interact and abil to explain thing also my teacher dont email back quickli or provid me with support when i need it unlik just ask a question and get an immedi repli on zoom etc
engag with teacher ensur you are understand and obtain inform
you know more what import
i can watch then at ani time and can watch then sever time so it help when it’ revis time
more activ abl to ask question
is most like actual teach and it also way more effect in learn the materi than just read slide etc
actual interact with the lectur and can ask question and discuss the topic rather than passiv watch a lectur which is extrem difficult complex without the opportun for question etc
instant respons from other face to face learn so more focus
ask question
becaus you’r interact with the teacher and classmat and so you can have better discuss
it’ engag but without need continu concentr
abl to finish the task given faster instead of have long zoom call

i can then digest the inform in my own time and make my own note
i feel like watch record lectur is realli passiv i don’t know if i’m actual learn anyth and it’ a big chang from how we where taught in person becaus we use socrat and now we are just be talk at and the lectur can’t see if they are go too fast or we don’t understand zoom session at least have an interact element and we can ask question etc it also feel more like a commun when you can see the peopl in your class face
as you can write your note while watch the video
it allow us to have activ convers with our peer and teacher which we would normal have in school so i guess it creat a sens of ‘normality’
thi way we can somehow engag in the lesson by answer question in the chat and also ask ani question i might have rather than have to email my teacher if i wa watch a stream of the lesson which they have record with anoth class and ask us to watch it as our own lesson
can watch the lectur when it is most conveni for you
i can do it al my own time

it easi to go back over to take break if i need them
it’ easier to take thing at my own pace
less pressur to be fulli focus and have the energi to be present becaus work in my famili home is difficult
i like to be abl to paus or rewind what a teacher is say without disrupt the flow for other and i find live video quit stress as all sort can go wrong
allow me to go through the work at my own pace look thing up as i need to but it also meant that i could email my teacher with question and get a fairli quick respons
the closest thing to a real life face to face lectur can get immedi answer to question
it’ access for me and i prefer a largerclass becaus you get more opinion and it hit differ
more interact
i can organ my time by myself and watch lectur whenev i want also i can paus video or rewatch it if need
it is a million time more engag than a record lectur that i just fall asleep dure forc me to keep a routin and get some good old social interact too
less distract teacher is teach you not yourself
i have a schedul it feel more like a “normal” class i can ask question in real time we can have group discuss
easier to access the materi
i dont wast time and studi better at my own
it’ better than just have the lectur slide upload but easier than have to do a zoom class
it give more time to write note and allow me to watch the video when it suit me
you are abl to get the work done at your own pace without the pressur of the rest of the class do it as the same time
it help me to engag in depth with the materi which make recal it easier for me
more hand on teach from my teacher which help my understand
i understand the work more and can better commun and issu
allow for live interact with and feedback
more interact
we are abl to interact and when ask question there is immedi respons
i prefer hear the lecturer’ voic while they are explain a concept rather than read about it
ask question share idea
it easier to follow along and paus if need to properli understand the content
it is the most similar to sit in actual class and i genuin feel like i’m learn someth
it feel like a ”real” lectur
it is more help and you can learn when you want
becaus we get to interact and we also have someon make sure were actual studi and not like knit or someth
give more structur to my day it’ similar to what my normal class are so it wasn’t hard to adapt also i studi engin so studi upload materi without have a professor explain it is difficult
you can learn more from record video than by simpli upload powerpoint present
as it make me feel engag and remain focus on my subject
i learn better from have thing explain to me and when it’ record i can stop replay make note etc so it’ a good balanc of hear my teachers’ voic while not be left behind in a live chat
easier feedback
can do it in a schedul that work best for me
i’m do a music degre so it’ way easier to play live and have immedi feedback from teacher instead of wait for them to watch it and then possibl confus over what they mean etc

everyth is in write which help me learn better
more like the usual teach experi
becaus take into consider the mani distract that my enviro may have thi way i can stop and replay whenev i want to so that i dont miss ani info
actual learn someth becaus if i’m left to myself i won’t do it
discuss with teacher and other student and abl to ask question live zoom meet are also record and upload onto googl classroom for student who are unabl to attend and it is use to look back on meet
i prefer have an onlin live class as oppos to just be assign work that i have to figur out on my own
you can paus and rewind if you need and take a break if it a lot of inform in one class
it closer to a normal lectur in school which feel more normal
record lectur let me jump back and forth to content that i don’t fulli grasp and although they may not fulfil the need of have the support of a teacher for question at that moment they let me set my own schedul and take my time with the content i’m learn
it give you the freedom to choos when is most conveni for you to learn the materi
so that i can schedul and work out the time i need which is mostli less than the teacher would give in class
i would like if they did onlin class at my school as i feel like i would be more product as it’ more similar to a classroom environ rather than look at a document which ha been upload
i miss have interact with teacher and want to see them everi day
becaus it almost like be in a classroom on campu which is what i learn from the most
it feel more real
it give you the option to revisit the materi for futur studyrevis of the topic cover in the class
less pressur than live discuss
i feel that live class enabl better conect between the student and the lectur than record or email materi an thi is realli import to me just hear the professor voic and see hisher face is make me more enthusiast and motiv to attend lectur and is way more fun and person also
i can paus the video if i need a moment to process what i just learn or if i need some more time to take note i can rewatch the video if i didnt understand it from the first time
it forc me to be focus and prepar for the class
im a geolog student and it realli hard to learn throw email becaus we actual have to analyz the rock or do microscop research in the current situat i find it easier to learn in a live class so that the teacher can explain with more detail
i’m abl to engag with my teacher and a few of my classmat to ask question discuss topic in more detail etc
i can do it in my own time and focu on the section that i want to in more depth and without the time pressur
becaus it allow you to interact with the teacher
becaus you see all the other and it is more fun
i find it better in term of learn becaus it is not an unilater lesson but student can ask question and understand the subject on a deeper level in thi way onlin lesson becom veri similar to our convent school lesson
you can rewatch and easili take noteshav someth to go back to
feel more direct and easi
you can ask question live and it’ easier to engag
allow realtim engag with other student and the teacher
it’ easier to understand the materi when someon talk about it to me
it’ easier to get the topic and ask question if there are ani
abl to commun with lectur and other student easier
with live class you are forc to particip and forc to hear the audio from your instructor other method are harder becaus of a lack of motiv with live class you can ask real time question and are forc to answer the other method who know if your do the work
it encourag open discuss and is the closest to facetofac teach
allow me to go back and paus whenev i don’t understand someth
im an independ learner and if i get stuck i can alway email my lectur ani question
someon explain it to me with the aid of lectur slide allow me to retain absorb and understand the content so much more
becaus you can organ yourself as you like and watch it at ani time in the day
becaus we can easili interact with the teacher
becaus we can easili ask question but we never get to use thi mode
i think i am abl to focu more
microsoft team

it still give us the support of a professor even though we are be taught onlin
can do it on your own timelin
it forc me to attend and be activ with record video or upload note i find myself passiv review without engag in the new materi
can schedul work at own timewhen best suit which help with motiv
it’ more motiv when someon is give the inform live and is avail there and then which allow for ani confus to be clear up instead of wait hour or day for a respons on a forum have live lectur get me up and readi for the day and make me more product
more interact that record lectur
i can’t alway attend live lectur at the time they happen so have them be record make manag my time easier
flexibl

work can be explain easier thi way as you are abl to talk to class mate and tutor
becaus it’ more interact and feel more normal
it’ easi access and reliabl
easi to ask for clarif and question more engag requir
much more interest and easier to learn and keep focu
i can repeat or watch it again
becaus we’r use to have class live whether it’ onlin or physic we’r abl to have the same form just onlin where we can instantli ask the teacher question just like we would physic

a lot easier to ask question and a more in depth understand of the task
becaus i can work in my own pace and i can decid when i work i also can decid what i spend my time on what’ “ worth” do and invest time in
i don’t realli have experi with the other mode i am more motiv by live class becaus they ‘force’ you to pay attent and react to your teacher and other student in the chat
becaus it is often set out in high detail and easier to follow in my opinion
you can do the work at your own pace and fulli understand it befor move onto the next lectur also if the wifi is bad that day then i can watch it anoth day wherea i would have miss the live class which would be bard to catch up
i am abl to replay part of the lectur i do not understand
can do it at your own pace
i feel like in call you do not realli have the time to properli think about question befor anyon els alreadi answer them also i think i would definet prefer video call if they werent the way they are rn for instanc we are not use a goodwork platform neither do our teacher explain anyth or let us habe discuss everi call is about half an hour long and we talk mostli about stuff we alreadi did or sth organis
i learn so much better when someon is explain the materi than me just read it on my own
more interact
can ask question get to see other student and have the same support system with each other
becaus i get to see and hear my porfessor and classmat it make is slightli more normal
zoom call or live class are usual awkward but i find it help to have a visual and an audio compon
better to see everyon and ask question in real time as well as here the view and knowledg of your peer
email materi
it take interact
i can studi the materi by my own but still have the face to face moment with my teacher which are veri use for instant question that are pop up or prepar question
easier to understand what the teacher want from our work
i can do thing at my own pace and don’t have to wast my time in class where i usual don’t learn much anyway
faster way to get answer from teacher and more engag
i can watch whenev i want to even rewatch i can take note write up my question and send them to the teacher or the studi group so everyon can see
much more product and forc me to actual do the work
easi to follow abl to ask question

allow me to watch the lectur at my own pace and the audio and visual help me to understand the topic
i feel comfort and can go over anyth that is discuss use thi method
more interact
more interact
i feel like i actual am in class and can activ learn
in turkish univers gener cours are live class and these class must record in order to access for unavali studend watch or review later i think thi is the best prefer mode for me
i find zoom class are somewhat useless and ineffici — it feel like my instructor just tri to fill the time with busi work or random discuss
it feel most similar to a classroom set
don’t have to show your face or speak
becaus in my citi the most part of the peopl doesn’t have good access to the internet
you can get immedi feedback
allow for ask question
it is more interact and mirror what in school lesson would be like also would be nice to see teacher and friend even if it wa virtual
you can hear concept be explain as mani time as you need
most realist to a classroom set
becaus i can watch it whenev i want and also becaus i can replay it if i didnt understood someth i think both part teacher and student could be more benefit from thi way
i do a btec and essenti the end of thi year we have been just complet assign and so call arent entir requir i do like the social we get from talk to the teacher as the call are mostli how we are do
can be taken at own pace in your own time
actual discuss with teacher that we are unabl to current have and a way to keep up product and not fall behind
you can ask question and get an immedi answer
it mean there is still face to face time to ask question rather than it be lost in a podcast
you can do everyth when you want at your own pace
it take place at a certain time which hold me account to devot thi time onli for studi i also know that i am not abl to stop the lectur or replay it later which make thi time veri product becaus i have to focu fulli on the lectur
it is the most engag for my degre sociolog so allow for discuss
i can work through the work at my own pace in order to fulli understand the content
it allow for a level of direct contact with teacher without involv direct particip in the way that live class do
you can still seespeak to your teacher face to face which bring an element of normal to the situat
be abl to discuss idea and be present while learn is incred import to the process
one to one with the teacher
easier to focu when a teacher is walk through it otherwis i am tempt to just do work quickli to get it done but not realli take it in
you can ask question and get an answer immidi
more engag with the professor
it the closest to in person learn im an auditori learner so i need at least a video and zoom class are the closest thing to teach in a classroom that my professor have
can discuss idea with peer without anxieti of group call
it give me freedom in when i can learn
idk
closest method in mimick facetofac lecturingteach
feel as though your in a classroom within the comfort of know that home life couldn’t get in the way
it is easili access at ani time and it you didnt understand the first time you can relisten the lectur again
more motiv to do it
i can interact with the instructor and other student
it’ live
abl to interact with the lectur or tutor and ask question as we would do in a normal lectur
i have to be present and concentr becaus the professor are randomli call on peopl also i can immedi ask question and get feedback to my work
i learn more with activ engag
it allow me to work at my own pace and concentr on the thing i find hard
it help me feel motiv and engag dure the lectur
it’ interact and i they can see you
becaus it’ live you can have a better understand and you can ask you teacher everyth more easili
it much more interact and i feel more engag in the content i am more like to rememb it if i have an interact lesson
it allow for live interact with my peer and instructor
becaus we still get to interact and discuss with other student
i think it’ closest to studi at school you can ask question at the exact moment you need to and it’ easier to get start with exercis after even a short live session
it allow me to learn thing at my own pace and onli have to go over the thing that i specif don’t understand
easi to ask qs and allow student to work togeth
easi to usdertabsd
becaus i can watch it on my own time and replayrewatch the part that i don’t understand
more engag easier to ask for help
immediaci of questionansw process and the abil to retain connect with staffstud
becaus i prefer have my time and learn thing with my own method
it’ the most similar to actual be in a lesson
feel more person can ask question nice to interact with lecturersclassm dure these isol time schedul love class add structur to my daysweek
the teacher can explain tricki concept
it more engag that watch a lectur
allow me to pauseskip and go at my own speed
sometim it’ hard to engag with onlin class
easi to view
less technic and internet issu interf than when live
i think i would enjoy it becaus it allow you to be more engag both audio and visual and you could do it at your own pace my prof onli upload note so it wa veri hard to be motiv or engag
i find it hard to pay attent to my 2 hour class onlin i’d much prefer to read the materi myself and take note
you can have interact with fellow student and help each other
i find read larg bulk of inform quit difficult so have someon els do the talk help to keep me focus
can go back and take more note if i need
i get to ask question to the teacher
if you miss anyth you can skip back and you can take your time write note
it is more effect than real class or individu studi
i’m more engag if it’ live
i can take my own time to go through the work allow me to get a better understand of it as it is not rush
give a sens of normalci and is also more person
becaus i get to studi the class whenev i find it best and i get to rewatch them until i understand fulli what is be thaught
i think live class would be good if the student actual interact with the professor also if camera were turn on for both student and teacher in all of my class noon turn on their camera not even the teacher
becaus i prefer to be in a distanc environ regard onlin class
make me feel comfort
i can choos when to watch them and i get less distract
live stuff doesnt go as smooth i can work at my own pace
it would ensur that i actual do the work not procrastin
the whole class is abl to interact with one anoth the teacher is more access for advicehelp
it is closer to a classroom enviro and let me ask question
to be honest i prefer a mixtur between onlin class and record class becaus it provid other resourc that we can use when we are feel bore of the same method of learn for exampl sometim i struggl with concentr dure my onlin lectur becaus it is veri easi to drift off when hide behind a screen so record lectur precis a sort of ‘backup’ for those day where the concentr moral is low i chose onlin lesson becaus person i think the main advantag of onlin lesson over record lesson is that we are abl to ask question and particip more howev there is also the issu of shyness and fear of be wrong which prevent me from voic my concern sometim the privat chat option on zoom realli help with thi in malta it seem that live session are prefer over the other method as far as i know on the downsid i am get pretti fed up of onlin lectur as i feel as if i am not abl to fulli participateengag in my learn and there are a lot of distract such as phone nois pet parent sibl etc
can ask ani question straight away and it is the most like real life i suppos
better commun
social contact
i can paus the video at ani time and go back and watch thing again
i am not tie down to a schedul
it is easiest to go at my own pace and i can go back and doubl check thing if i am unsur
more engag with the task howev i do like work by myself so i’m not too bother
face to face convers allow me to ask question and get respons immedi
the onli option for me
it’ more interact and motiv you to do the work when you know you have to attend a schedul live lectur or seminar
it allow for me to learn at my own pace and structur my day around school work give me time to explor differ thing and go even deeper into the topic be taught thi in turn reduc my stress and anxieti level and ha increas overal happi well
allow interact with other student and staff i feel less alon at home allow more question to be ask mostli nice to have other interact keep me to a schedul more than record lectur
becaus i can plan my own time and be veri flexibl
i like know other peopl are join at the same time a sens of commun and it help me keep account on the work becaus i have to prepar for class at a certain day and time instead of whenev
more product abl to chat to tutor whilst they are teach
you can do it on your own schedul no need to be present at 8am for a class
it is more like learn in person i think you learn more when there are other peopl to bounc idea off it’ also more motiv when it’ a live class you know you have to attend
i find work easier to understand when it’ explain audibl by a teacher
it allow the student to ask the teacher question and make engag with the subject easier
is easier to understand
most like a normal lesson we can interact with the teacher easili and ask question as we go along
allow me to paus and rewind so if i don’t understand someth or i need a break i have that option also be abl to watch thing on 15x speed is great
your free to do it whenev you feel like it
feel most real and can ask question with instant respons
feel most like a real class can ask question right away engag is high
it is the most similar to school and we still get to interact with our teacher and classmat
it mean you can interact and hold you account if you actual have to speak to someon
i will be abl to learn each lessonconcept at my own pace while also understand the topic from my instructor rather than do assign and not fulli grasp what i am learn
more interact and abl to ask question
social anxieti
becaus i like hear the teacher speak rather than read the lesson it harder to piec everythibg togeth otherwis
becaus it interact and push you more to take part
can go over it more than onc
allow us to engag with materi in our own time
you do not have to particip in a live video record
it is like be in class and is more visual wherea our method of upload stuff and be sent email reli on one abil to teach oneself
have to show up be present and the possibl to get call on hold me account more than ani other mode of onlin teach
i take veri interact subject like english which requir discuss and other interpret and also it forc me to be product as motiv myself to do question that are just set onlin is veri difficult and i often don’t do them
more interact feel like more worth for money
i can do them at ani time
you can ask question and get a respons straight away and is the most engag
get to work through question
as it more access when internet connect level is low
we are abl to talk to each other and work togeth in group it is also easier to learn the materi when the teacher is talk rather than just read
i can work at my own pace and can better structur my time
it limit my freedom to choos whenev i want to do someth and therefor keep my procrastin in check
easi to access help at ani time
better commun with teacher
becaus it allow for the work to be fulli explain in detail
becaus you can follow the lesson on your own pace
i could schedul my time
you can actual see the teacher and ask question so there is also more pressur to complet the work as they have seen you
the collabor environ though my internet didn’t alway work
you get to catch up with everyon and give feedback on each other work
you can ask question
more person interact and an abil to ask question directli to the teacher
i feel more inclin to particip and connect to fellow student which i highli valu from a learn experi i actual would prefer a hybrid instruct that combin pre record screencast for the main instruct present from the instructor and then shorter live discuss
becaus it the closest to real lesson
i’m abl to go back and make more note if i need to and not just reli on one live video to make all my note
feel more like an actual classroom
it explain the content the best
you can paus the video if you need addit time and it is much more organis than zoom lectur
less confus more efect
can access at most convient time can rewatch and paus the video to take better note lectur tend to be more structur and flow better as oppos to the zoom lectur
bc i can read through at my own pace and reorganis my note that work in a way for me
quit often on live class on zoom etc there were delay connect issu although it’ harder to discuss thing on pre record lectur it’ easier to understand all the info
interact with friend and the teacher
make me account it is also a more structur type becaus you can’t do it at anoth time the record class take a lot more motiv
you can particip and ask question
it give you the opportun to ask question live
give the option to obtain quick feedback on question about the content of the class
i can plan de video’ around my schedul so i have more free time
can paus and rewind to creat more detail note

almost human interact
we also use live class for some purpos and i found it veri awkward a lot of the time attend wa often poor and engag wa low there were a lot of awkward silenc and paus record lectur mean i can do everyth at my own pace
can ask question
can ask question present can be tailor to what the group need more like regular colleg
it help to be abl to paus the lectur when they go too fast but the lack of interact between lectur and student is definit not good

it give larger room for new idea
it feel person is the closest to “normal” lesson at school

becaus it ha the mix between a lectur like it is at uni and the interact with question it doesnt differ that much from what i am use to at uni
becaus it is still facetofac physic learn involv the teacher student relationship and interact it is also proactiv mean that you can ask question and have them answer as a classroom layout would also accommod

less stress flexibl learn time
much more interact almost feel like real lesson and can ask question and discuss also good from a socialis point of view

we can ask question and engag in a twoway convers rather than passiv work
more engag less like to zone out and not take in content
easi too ask question and also explain your question further when it is misunderstood
i don’t like ani of these method
it difficult to learn just from pdf when there are record lectur it much easier to understand which point are most import and person it suit my learn style much better not a visual learner

becaus we haven’t been given anoth other mode
it’ better to interact with the lectur if need and it’ more relev to what you want to know we had last year lectur upload which weren’t person to our year

it give me the freedom of complet the assign at ani time rather than feel the pressur to be there
abl to talk and get question answer without the anxieti of a video call
it allow me to have a proper interact with the professor
uncomfort with live class
becaus for the type of learn my cours requir languag face to face interact is much more impact

upload materi are my prefer mode becaus i am abl to work at my own pace and research on my own it allow me to take my time and email my teacher if i need help
can do it at my own leisur don’t have to show my face lool
it’ the most like real lectur
most engag when the teacher ha contact with me i’ll be more motiv
i can work at my own pace and in my own time
better than upload content as more info is brought across and not as intens as live zoom call
more interact and engag add structur and routin to studi at home
upload or email materi
it the onli way
i feel more inclin to stick to my timet and i’m less like to get distract by my phone etc
becaus i feel like it’ clearer when the teacher cannot be disturb

i like the idea that the lesson are live just like they’d be in normal school
can learn at my own pace
less anxieti
can ask question live and get an immedi answer from lectur
less stress even if live class are a good method of learn and mayb you are more involv it stress
upload or email materi
it someth between prerecord lectur and zoom session i have one professor who upload 1020 min video on each subject and offer a zoom meet onc a week to answer question so i actual prefer both becaus i can watch the video at my own pace and becaus they are divid into mani short video it not too much inform to process as it would be with an hour long lectur
i can take note and rewind at my own pace to retain the inform much better
it the closest to what we usual have and is tie with upload materi
becaus if i dont have a specif time to do a task like be present at a zoom lectur at a certain time i end up procrastin a lot i cannot manag my time effici on my own
there’ a specif schedul you don’t have to invent
i feel oblig to paus or replay certain part with record lectur if i miss someth or someth went to quickli for me to write it all down which make listen to them so much longer than a live lectur and sinc you can paus you tend to lose focu quicker as “you can paus anytim anyway so it doesn’t matter” i feel i would focu better dure a live lectur as then it is the onli time i can actual hear the info be explain to me and it take a set amount of time so i know exactli what to expect on how much time it is go to take
it feel more as if i’m actual be taught my teacher just post tell us to learn someth and don’t teach it
i like the possibl to directli interact with the professor and other student
when class are live it easier to mang your time and you have more a feel of engag my live class start normali at 830 so i have to wake up at time when they are record i tend to sleep in and lose a lot of time

becaus it allow interact with the lectur and feel less distant and disconnect
allow you to stay connect to fellow class member and your teacher also they can see your face so they can tell instantli if your confus or don’t understand you can also get instant help and ask question alon with discuss
allow interact with the instructor
we havent been have live class but from what i’v seen and heard they would benefit me so much more
more interact can ask question and it feel the closest to actual be in a classroom
i appreci that the lectur is on hand for question to lead activitiesdiscuss and that i can still interact in some way with my peer
it’ closer to what it’ like in real life and ha the ad bonu of be abl to paus to make note
there is more in the moment interact therefor more activ learn
you can take the time you need and work at the time you’r most product at
easier to understand when a teacher is actual explain someth rather than just powerpoint
you can relisten it
i get to do the work whenev i want
i am abl to paus and make note at my own speed but still have the explan of a teacher
i would rather get the assign and work on my own rather than listen to a zoom lectur i find it more product to do actual work and get assist from my teacher
you truli can do it in your own speed or time when you‘r at home all the time it‘ nice to be abl to pick your own speed and schedul
closest to our real class opportun to ask question directli
it is more similar to ‘normalreal’ school
proper content give time to make note and save lectur for a later date so valuabl
i am abl to commun with classmat in real time and get instant answer from my cours leader
it is the main one use
becaus i usual get distract dure live class and becaus it is easier for me to take note and understand a topic when i studi by myself while watch record lecturesvideo
i can do the work in my own time
becaus thi and discuss chat were the onli two use and the discuss chat were pointless
it allow me to studi at my own pace instead of tri to catch up to peopl who alreadi know about the topic or have to slow down for peopl who dont even though in school wed have to adjust with onlin class the number of student have increas not technic in school these are cours for univers entranc test so there are upto 3000 peopl from across the countri at time
easier and more person interact
it provid some form of face to face contact which i find easier to engag with and help when learn challeng materi
direct interact with my teacher
abl to interact oneonon
as it help me concentr better when i am just set work it is hard to stay focus where as have to be constantli on the ball listen to the teacher in case they pick on me is better
it the closest one to the real thing with some ad benefit like rewatch the lectur afterward
it is more interact and you can easili ask question
you can ask your doub in the same time your learn that new knowledg and get feedback in that same second
i could get help from classmat as well as the teacher
it help me stay engag and excit about class when i can see the face of my teacher and classmat
you are abl to interact with your teacher
thi way it is easier to interact and ask question
can use thi at ani time and take my time and go at my own pace to understand thing better
becaus i enjoy activ learn and interact with my peer
it is more up to date than old record and best replic the normal uni experi
it’ the closest teach techniqu to how we learn in school
becaus i can go back and watch it over and over until i understand
thi method allow for a certain degre of autonomi and selfstructur while maintain a person level of instruct and normalci with a “facetoface” inspir instruct style
answer get immedi respons and nice to just see people’ face
it is probabl the closest replic of what teach wa like pre covid and still encourag activ involv

i have more flexibl with when i can attend lectur
encourag you particip and it’ the onli option i’v been given

i like go through lectur in my own time i did thi befor the viru as well i would go to my lectur then go through the record afterward
no live class were offer by my uni but i feel that they would have been a better and more direct substitut for normal class
becaus i can easili commun my problem or discuss
make it more personalr than just someth upload though thi ha it own benefit too seem a bit more with the money
becaus you can ask question in real time and get answer quickli and bc you can particip which is grade in my case
get the most for what you are pay for
easi to interact “directly”
feel more like a classroom
i am more alert caus the teacher could call our name at ani time therefor i make doubl effort to pay attent and get a better grasp of the concept
becaus you actual get to engag more with the class activ
i can do it on my own schedul
becaus i can understand what the professor is mean and also play it back when ever i want it
easier to followaccess
i find it difficult and awkward to interact over video call and i can do everyth at my own pace as it’ harder now everything’ onlin
haven’t had the chanc to experi the other as our school ha onli upload materi noth els
can ask question in real time
you get interact with your instructor and they can then tailor the materi or help with part that you don’t understand
i am in a time zone 9 hr behind my school so thi way i dont have to wake up between 24am for class
it allow me to paus rewind keep and fulli take in the content
hold me account to attend the class more engag mean i can rais issu straight away
i can complet in my own time but it is also use as the teacher is go through the work like it would be in class
easi and interact
becaus it’ most like in person class
becaus i am free to choos when to watch the record lectur and to take paus whenev i need them addit i dont miss ani inform if the internet didnt work dure live class
becaus we can learn everyth at our own pace and we can ask the teacher question via email if we don’t understand someth
as i am abl to commun with my teacher and fellow student in live time
it ha the most interact which give me more motiv
similar to a seminar for be abl to have a discuss
my question can be answer immedi
feel the most normal interact on a webcam feel like a better discuss than forum feel more like a seminar
more interact
caus i can paus video when i need more time to write a point down and it’ not as awkward as video chat also when it’ takin a long to get to a point i can just speed it up
easier to engag
my live zoom were still conduct at the same class time which made it easier to keep my previou colleg schedul wherea my record lectur were upload at inconsist time
i like to be abl to give question
can be done at ani time
it is the one that resembl the tradit type of learn the most it feel more engag and it help me have a structur to my day as they are schedul at fix hour
as i am abl to engag with teacher and talk about ani problem that aris in real time it is especi use for languag subject such as french as speak ha an import role in the subject
i learn better in an environ where i can interact with my teacher directli dure lesson which make the live class realli use for me
i do not like the pressur of zoom seminar
i find it hard to focu on live lesson while at home i get distract too easili so have the materi and time to work on them at my own pace is realli help
independ learn at my own pace
more connect
more interactivr
i find it best becaus i can do the work at my own pace time and place
i love interact and it help me rememb the materi more

it help me get a better understand and the inform stay in my head for longer
it allow me to work at my own pace
id rather it be taught like an actual face to face lesson rather than a list of unguid resourc my colleg tutor have not been use zoom lesson at all but i think it would be realli benefici so that we dont fall behind
it allow me to go back and take more in depth note
more interact and can ask question when you think of them rather then through email which can take more time the vibe is more similar to be in an actual classroom
i studi languag and it the best way to practic convers and get social interact
becaus it feel most interact and closest to normal as possibl
we get to interact more and get our doubt clear without keep it for later
i would allow me to engag with my teacher and ask question more easili
our lectur were alway record so i usual watch them instead of attend it as i could watch it in 2x speed and honestli also the lectur hall at lse are realli uncomfort
easier to process info when it’ be spoken instead of read it off a page
i enjoy be abl to take class at a time that is conveni to me i find that with record lectur i can listen when i am in the right headspac so i find myself pay more attent and truli listen to the teacher i also have the freedom of schedul my daysweek to my own like for better balanc and product
i do modern languag so need to speak
it’ as close as we can get to a classroom set the teacher can explain concept and it’ more person
feel the most like “normal school” easier to express yourself
i’m abl to benefit from my teacher explain everyth thoroughli whilst still be abl to paus the video to work at my own pace
it’ more interact and it give me the chanc to give idea as well as receiv new thought and idea also if i have a question or someth i want to say it make it easier to talk about it rather than email it and get a respons day later
interact you get to ask question and engag with your tutor in the spot
in part becaus i have not realli experienc the other to actual prefer them but also becaus i appreci a dynam learn experi where i can interact convers and ask question with peer and professor
it is comfort to be abl to take the lectur at ani time also don’t feel the pressur to particip also if some of the content is too easi can easili skip forward or if someth is unclear go listen to it again i know that particip would be good but perk of remot school have that it’ not forc
it feel more similar to the actual thing
feel as close to normal as possibl
it’ more interact and i have some form of structur
i do a stem degre so lectur are an import part of learn ie discuss is great but it not as applic as in the human i enjoy live lectur becaus i can ask question dure them like i would in a convent class and that realli boost my understand
you can do the work on your own time
live class
becaus one ha the time to complet the work in their own time without have to be monitor by a teacher although it depend on the subject such as math one need live class
becaus i can learn at my own pace
i can stop and go over someth
i find it easier to engag in my own time rather than on a set schedul at home
it’ interact
everyth is explain without distract from the class
more interact and hold attent better
can ask question in the moment rather than commun via email which can take time
it ha the teacher explain the content but i can go back if i haven’t fulli understood everyth
less pressur than be in a live class i can take my time do my work
it allow to take note in own style and learn in way that suit us after watch the lectur
it mean i can do it in my own time
it is more person than just be email inform but isn’t as much of a high pressur intens situat as a group zoom call would be
it deliv inform in a way that is benefici in term of speed of learn and can be refer to after discuss etc
it allow for in depth in understand
if there a set time im more motiv to do it
i learn to manag my time better thi way by choos prioriti
lectur where i can take note
idk
becaus it allow me and other to ask ani question we have about the work that ha been set and it also make me feel like i am at school and give me a reason to keep to my usual school schedul
i can work at my own pace
there is more interact
i get a bit dozi watch video and with live chat and zoom you cannot go back if you miss a bit etc
can do it in my own time
i can learn at my own pace paus and research someth and fewer technic difficulti
possibl to pauselisten again
i can work at my own pace
no social interact
can rewindskip back as need can watch more than onc
it allow me to organ my work on my own pace and go back to relisten if need
it’ the best mean of commun
socialis we don’t have live class but i wish there wa becaus i think i’d be more motiv
becaus i get to rewatch it as mani time as i need to fulli understand the topic but it still be present to me in a teach form my teacher is speak to me
more direct abl to discuss feel like normal uni

caus live class help you to make a connect with the educ you get through your teacher and your classmat and also make everyth easier becaus you feel motiv
anxieti around video call
it is most interact and i actual rememb some new materi
i can do the work whenev i want and i don’t have to get up earli for a live class
more engag and interact
live class and discuss form caus anxieti record lectur are bore prefer to do more independ studi closer to exam
you can get instant respons and feedback
the commun aspect
i like be abl to engag with the lectur by askingansw question and join in discuss
it mean that if i wa busi or work at the time of the lectur i could watch it when it wa conveni for me
becaus it is more like a classroom environ where i have direct support from peopl when work
i dont like video call peopl it make me anxiou
it’ the easiest mode to take use note from
easier to understand
more motivationpressur to activ particip
i like live class becaus i can see the teacher and other student and be activ particip and ask question
content specif relat to cours can paus rewind
more room for engag easier to stay focus
can watch them again
topic and concept are explain but i still have the abil to paus the video to write note or refer back to it
you are be taught by your teacher but you can also paus rewind or speed up what is go on
can do on own time
give me a schedul and hold me account to actual do the work on time
i can access it anytim i want
it maintain the feel of a “real” offlin class while at the same time it give me more confid to particip in class discuss
it more engag and colabor and give me the option to ask about what i dont understand right away
it allow you to send question immedi
it is the least anxieti provok and allow you to work at you’r own pace
i think it is import to discuss with peer there is lot of detail to learn with my cours medicin so it is use to discuss in order to maximis understand
can do in your own time and at your own pace
becaus i can watch as mani time as i want and studi for the assign by listen the professor over and over again
becaus it allow student to attend class in their own time especi sinc we were no longer at physic univers so the circumst that onc may have enabl someon to go to a class at a certain time may have chang also it’ nice to be abl to listen to a lectur again after you’v review the materi yourself to make sure you understand everyth or if you’v miss anyth
can chat to peopl on cours freeli perhap whilst the lecturerseminar leader is speak without ani issu with delay video or audiopressur
feel more like a real lesson
becaus you get the materi your work with explain and it isnt just someth you have to fulli teach it to you yourself
so i an interact thi my academ and classmat it give a sens of normal to the learn process
more effici for me to get my work done on my own rather than have to go through it at a class pace
i enjoy the fact that it is so interact it feel the closest to actual school
i find it easier to understand thing when i have the abil to discuss them
record lectur and watch the teacher fill out the note and work through problem the same way they would in a physic classroom help me understand the materi better than just read it on my own or copi a complet note even though i cant ask for clarif while the lectur is happen i am abl to realli take time and go back when i need to
it easi
can interact with the lectur similar to a real lectur schedul
more engag
onlin lectur don’t help and the onlin materi make it easier to do alon
full explan of content without a set time
although my univers is in the uk i am an intern student so the time zone is differ
i can alway refer back to them wherea our class are not record so if you didn’t catch what wa said then you miss out
forc you to pay attent and have routin
more interact easier to keep pay attent
becaus i can watch it back and listen to it at my own schedul that i plan for myself
most realist to facetofac teach
i can go at my own pace
you can easili ask the professor a question if you have one
you can take the lesson at your own pace
feel more like the real thing and add a bit more visualis to the learn
we can freeli interact with our teacher to ask question
easier to understand if explain person by your own teacher
becaus i dont have to actual ineract with my teacher and i can do the work whenev i want to as long as i respect the deadlin
becaus it is still social and convers
it is easi to revis the inform guarante that i’ll be abl to access it even if my broadbandwifi isn’t work it’ excel in conjunct with occasion zoomsemail correspond
it hold the opportun to ask question or share opinion immedi rather than record lectur
zoom call feel a bit unprofession and there’ less anxieti with just all the info be on one page without have to speak to peopl
you are more engag when a lectur is live and much more like to attend the lectur instead of just have a prerecord lectur that you can view at ani time
record lectur allow me to manag my time better than attend live class i also exploit the possibl to speed it up or rewind the part that i don’t understand clearli ideal combin with discuss forum to make up for the lost interact
it kept the same as what we had at uni at my uni we didnt have discuss or seminar etc just lectur
it’ an easier way to commun with classmat and teacher
forc you to attend class
interact
i understabd better
they are easi to follow along to and understand
becaus the teacher and the student can interact and therefor the workload can be alter to manag amount via email the teacher ha no feel for the understand of the class for the subject and the doabl workload is overestim
easier to commun
becaus it not that differ from class at uni
better explan
quizz and chat with other make the activ learn much more effici and interact
you can rewind if you miss someth chang the speed to what suit you best and i find it easier to learn with a professor explain someth rather than read upload materi
becaus i learn a languag it’ so import to have convers educ
i understand everyth better
it’ the most real we can get and i love the interact and discuss we are abl to have
it way better to understand
i am not confid video call on platform such as microsoft team etc but i find listen to a lectur is use
know that it’ live and be abl to speak to my class mate and my professor at the same time help me to keep focu
becaus the teacher can explain thing i dont fulli understand
it allow student to understand the materi on their own even though it can be a bit much sometim and even though there are except i have learn more from those assignmentsmateri than i did dure onlin class also it truli distinguish between student who actual tri to put in some effort and those who see thi as a vacat i’m not tri to offend anyon sinc all of us have differ approach and cope mechan and lot of peopl includ me can be a mixtur of those two in term of product but i tri to stereotyp the situat as much as i could to help with your research
you can watch it when it suit you and you paus it and watch it again if you need it
you have provid content which you can structur on your own
help you consolid knowledg and your understand better
i can get extra inform and answer straight away rather than wait for an email
abl to ask question which allow me gain a better understand
you can fulli interact with your teacher and classmat i find other method veri passiv
i think zoom meet are too chaotic but i miss have discuss with my fellow classmat that’ whi i like a discuss board becaus we are still abl to hear each other’ opinion
becaus then we’r abl to commun with teacher and other in the class while learn
more interact
you can ask question
we have more interact with stuff i think that motiv me more
i realli need the live interact to ask question as i learn new concept it also provid more structur
becaus it’ most like a classroom
i can sleep in paus and rewind whenev i need to
your teacher is there with you and you can ask them question
im more engag
it is easier to manag my time thi way when i control how long i take on work
becaus it is more interact
engag and keep routin to my life
i can rewatch them and still have a teachinglik experi
you get to hear from the student and help answer their question either as a teacher or as a peer
as long as they are suppli with correspond materi as have someon explain it make sens
feel more person and like an actual classroom
if feel like a normal class and i can’t get distract
i find it easier to engag and feel more motiv when i can see my professor and my peer
becaus it is live and you can ask question
best way of get inform
i would rather see the lectur teach than watch previous record slide with onli hisher voic i think see the lectur and know fellow student are log in watch at the same time make the lectur more interact howev visual powerpoint slide are a great advantag of previous record lectur that i believ should be integr into onlin zoom class
it help to understand the content but appli them as well
it let you work at your own pace but you still have the content explain
i havent had ani class in thi way and i have onli had core subject on team so i havent complet a number of modul that cant be taught on team but could be in engag onlin class
better and clearer understand of learn
thi is how our teacher measur our attend therefor it encourag me to actual go onto the call and get the work done i find with the subject where my teacher doesn’t do onlin call it is the subject i am fall most behind in
it’ more interact than prerecord lectur
would help if my teacher could do thi as mani student don’t understand the materi
becaus it’ hard to understand the assign and properli do them without instruct or lesson
independ to teach myself paus rewind etc though offic hour and assign are benefici to solidifi my knowledg
i like to be abl to ask question and get an immedi respons from my teacher
i can speak to the proffesor and they do the teach as they would in the normal condit
it make the class more interact we did have a few class on facebook live and i slept throughout them
you can interact with teacher like in normal class situat and ask question
it is most engag and similar to be in a lectur theatr it is actual almost better than physic class as we get the same experi but from our home
it is easier to follow and i get distract less
maintain a connect with your peer and teacher
activ learn and engag if content is hard to understand we can ask question and get a fast respons
conveni easi to follow no set time so can be done whenev
can ask question in realtim and do groupwork
human interact
i can ask question and i think it’ a more dynam way to learn
it allow face to face discuss lectur and group discuss all on one platform
becaus the internet connect isn‘t alway good enough for live class and i like watch it on the time i have time
it a verri interact way of learn sinc i studi on an art academi one of the best thing is hear feedback from classmat and teacher and to be abl to discuss thing when u are stuck also make it feel like your togeth a littl bit
i need interact in order to stay motiv
i can interact with other student and the lesson is more dynam
more interact more interest and keep you engag
becaus i can work at my own pace
for me person it is the most effect work mode becaus it definit provid more freedom as you get to schedul your day week on your own term instead of have to stick to fix time and date as it the case for live class etc
it ha less distract
ask question
more interact and social
becaus it allow me to studi at my own pace
i like to be abl to listen to the record at my own pace and go back to thing i miss or don’t understand
real time convo mean that’ anyth i am confus about can be rapidli and directli commun to my teacher
it give me a similar amount of structur as i got from in person class
can go through multipl time in case we miss someth
it is veri easi to get lost in the feel of be alon and not be abl to commun with other about school work is aw in the sens of motiv
possibl to ask question live and get instant repli can immedi explain a not understood topic again befor move on
more direct interact
rememb thing better when spoken to
to have question answer by the teacher i prefer learn by speech rather than read
it is easi as i dont have to be on call with anybodi as i am not comfort with that
it goe into more depth about the subject and give more detail
i am abl to have discuss about the topic with my classmat as well as the professor
it goe into more depth about the subject and give more detail
it give structur to my day rather than upload a lectur that can be work through tat ani point
it goe into more depth about the subject and give more detail
im abl to work through the materi in my own time ani put the focu where i need it to be
best for discuss and brief convers about the materi provid
it help me keep up with my workload
it is more interact and an activ learn process in comparison to go through power point on my own which i find harder as it doesn’t feel like i’m retain the knowledg in the same way
i’m veri use to the inperson lectur at school it forc me to fall into a routin now my professor do option offic hoursdiscussionschat i learn better through be in the structur routin of have a live classlectur at a set time
it is less lone and make me more motiv know the rest of my class is onlin at the same time
easier interact with teacher
abl to interact with lectur and other student
fewer technic problem and all the inform is definit given
it allow to have some sort of interact with the teacher
actual get interact
i like to have the feel of be in a normal classroom and to ask quest real time while see the respons directli and not over messag howev i also realli like pre record video as they are clearer to follow and can be watch again
becaus thi method allow me to work at my own pace
i have an auditori process disord so be abl to go througb work at my own pace is better for me
i actual prefer keep the varieti and not stick to just one mode i chose live class sole becaus i feel the most engag and the abil to ask question real time ha proven to be extrem benefici
app dont alway work on everyon devic or not everyon is abl to afford those deviceslaptop with cam etcbut nearli everyon ha a work comput
becaus i can paus a video if i’m struggl with the content can use my own time manag skill to dictat whenwher i want to learn
more interact but still flexibl with time
i dont find onlin class necessari or help
much more info
i am abl to work through the materi at my own pace
in my case the live class suck and the teacher onli realli ask how we where do so i’d prefer record class so i can just work through them in my own time and mayb ask question via chat or video afterward
you can ask question when thing are unclear
becaus i still have someon explain thing to me and i can rewatch moment i didnt properli understand i can paus to mayb research someth i didnt understand i can work when i have time
allow us to ask question in real time have genuin convers with our lectur
there is more interact between student and the lectur
engag
it feel the most like a classroom discuss the convers can flow easier
live question more engag feel closer to teacher and fellow student
i get to watch it comfort from my home bed and can rewarch it if necessari if i dont get around to prepar for a lesson it npt a big deal i can still listen and make note
i feel it bring a bit more normal to cours and allow for better engag in the materi be taught
it is easi for the work to be upload to the class then you have the opportun to ask question whilst independ work
you can paus the video whenev you need it allow you to take the time you need to process the content rather than move on with someth you dont understand you can adjust it to your own tempo and plan it in whenev you want
easier to get feedback learn with classmat
it’ more flexibl and i can go back to the resourc as mani time as i want
it allow me to studi at my own pace even though i do sometim feel like a live class can help explain thing better for me i like get a base level of knowledg by myself first
not tie down to a specif timecan organis your own timet also i would find onlin class a bit nervewrack and my internet connect is poor
own tempo
the can speed it up
it would provid more inform support
easier to look back on and the professor wa more comfort with thi as they avoid ani technic difficulti they could have encount with live record so the lectur wa off better qualiti
convers is more person and it mean i’m am held account to conplet my work
account not too differ from the actual classroom
allow the content to be understood more deepli and ani question answer immedi rather than risk have misunderstand that could impact the work
it easi and more effici than normal class
i prefer record lectur as i can take my time to understand and learn slowli in my own pace
i can plan my time better
less awkward
give you a chanc to ask question
get to talk to the tutor one on one and ask question in real time
becaus i can work on it whenev i have timei want
enabl you to do the work in your own time without distract
so you can learn from other and it’ less intimid than a zoom call
it enabl us to have a more activ learn
interact so more easi to be motiv
interact so i don’t lose focu and easili can ask question and i feel less lone haha
it’ easi to watch thing over and paus when need
you actual get to talk to your lectur and ask question
it give me the opportun to ask question and interact with my teacher it is the most similar to real life class
it allow for interact between the teacher and the student
i find it easier to follow as i can paus i write down be dyslex i find it veri hard to follow along live especi be at home and be surround by my sibl
can ask question and engag with the professor in current time
microsoft team allow discuss and chat forum so combin the best featur
i feel more engag and motiv
you can ask question directli and get answer in real time
it wa keep me sane and i wa also keep a contact with my professor and ta
you can watch anytim
give student the abil to learn materi on their own time and revisit an entir concept without have to be in person also replic an inclass experi instead of simpli upload note auditori element of a lectur
make me feel like i am in a real class and i can ask question at real time
make me that we are on track and and that everyon is follow up
interact
more interact can ask question and rememb more becaus of how interact it is
more interact and easier to feel motiv
interact and engag
i feel like i can it more person and we get to contribut more to shape our own learn and stay engag
becaus of the interact
i love be abl to interact with my classmat and teacher and ask question when need
it is most like a classroom set andgiv me a better sens of account
free to go through materi at my own pace
ani tipe of live class it’ more similar to normal class i can particip more
see my teacher’ and friend face make it feel like i’m in real school instead of some weird forum where work is option
i like how the teacher interact with hi student and it is so much easier to ask a question and get an answer right away instead of wait for the teacher’ respons through an email
in my school some teacher are onli send work through email and other prefer love class like i do i think it is realli good becaus we still have that kind of student teacher relationship as well as the one with the rest of the class and when student particip and ask question it alway help other
as it feel more like be in the classroom
it feel more like a real lectur compar to the other option
i feel it’ more plan out care rather than a live session where the feedback is mostli veri hectic although record one lack the immedi convers if it’ plan out in detail it is more prefer
becaus sinc it is pre record you can paus it or rewind it to relisten to anyth you might’v miss or to take in more detail
actual have to attend creat a routin i studi languag so the practic of them is imposs in a record lectur
becaus at my uni they combin video with the materi as prework and live class for ask question and learn to appli the concept and i find that i learn best on the class that follow thi method
i like to have the teacher put detail for what we need to be do and when they are say it over the phone i don’t have enough time to write thing or i might miss someth and we all don’t have time to answer the question and if it’ written or email then we are abl to commun on a one to one basi
it help me to stay focus
i’m abl to work through the materi at my own pace know that teacher are there to help is need but mostli trust us to tri get through it on our own first
i like to learn in my own term without feel the pressur of other classmat
i haven’t experienc it but it’ closest to a classroom environ
so that i can ask question live when they come in my mind and i get an answer immedi also i am forc to particip and can’t push it later
becaus you can ask question in real time and the teacher can explain thing to you
i can schedul my own time and decid for myself when im go to do my schoolwork even though my class are veri littl i still would like that extra freedom and it would also teach me the act of self disciplin
it can forc me more to attend and focu but actual our lectur are live and record so i felt lazi and didnt attend special that i had hard time cope with the chang but i think record alongsid live lectur is good for revis and in case sb had problem with internet dure live lectur
becaus it is flexibl for me and they still explain thing
still have some interact with classmat and a teacher
you can complet work at your own pace
more engag have to stay alert and involv
interact with a teacher and instant answer to question more motiv
becaus live class alway glitch a lot and they arent realli the same but i can do record lectur at my own pace if my school did them and i can easili ask the teacher if i have ani question by chat on team and i dont mind the upload materi too and then we just hand in our assign
more person and motiv
becaus you can work through it yourself and focu more on the thing you don’t understand like do research on your own be abl to have time for that if it wa conduct in a video format that would not be possibl
the teacher are abl to explain the new topic or share their screen so to let us see ani materi the find interest but there is still room for qiestion and discuss
i think through and understand thing better when i am given an opportun to discuss explain and ask question about topic
mean you can do the lesson at ani time suitabl for you and refer back to it when confus
im abl to sit down and practis what ive learn
it make it less time consum
less anxieti provok
can be refer back to at ani time
more discuss actual get to see peopl
i get to interact with my teacher everyon talk about miss their classmat but i miss my teacher i saw my favorit more than my parent dure the school year and miss them a lot
it’ closest to what i’m use to
more interact
can paus to get all the inform need
it allow you to commun with peopl on a more person level make get invest in class easier
you can talk to your teacher
opportun to ask question on the spot
the fact that the time is complet in my own control make watch them a veri intent decis becaus of that i pay much more attent furthermor i can paus and replay them as much as i want which make sure i don’t miss out on ani import inform
you get to discuss and interact and ask for help my school isn’t current do thi 😢
interact
easier to work through in my own time
it allow commun between myself and the teacher as well as other student
just so it is easier to understand
i can listen again if i have not understood someth or took note on a quot sourc it also super help to structur my summari becaus i can paus when listen a second time
in thi way although the lectur might go faster than in other way there is room for discuss and question can be ask so that student can get direct feedback whilst learn their content
i dont have to spend time talk to other and can focu on the work i need to do easili it also less complic
easier to understand content as you are go through it real time and feel more like classroom style teach
live class offer more engag and abil to ask question in the moment thi wa vital for financ and account base cours
question answer as i think of them
flexibl time manag
gmeet
becaus you can rewatch it if not understood or go at your own pace by paus and resum to take note stop to think etc
easier to explain my doubt
i can listen to the lectur anytim i want to and i can review it more than one time if i didn’t catch some inform
can paus and go back if i miss someth
becaus i can do it in my own time without the anxieti of a zoom call
it allevi pressur and procrastin
it promot more engag and ensur we know exactli what we’r do and can ask question
would be abl to ask question if i get stuck
more interact get to hear people’ idea more like actual class
abil to paus and allow for understand and more detail note
activ learn and still engag with professor and peer
i like have real interact and discuss
becaus our teacher explain us the cours materi in the same way as if we were at school an we can ask our question directli
can work at your own pace can paus if you don’t understand someth can work whenev you like without
becaus you can activ ask teacher question and get respond quickli
can paus and rewind
have live class onlin kept some form of routin as of i wa go to colleg although there were posit out of the prerecord lectur they often allow me to work when i chose i must say i can put thing on the long finger and get easili distract unless kept to a routin so the live class allow for that
it is easier to learn when you’r actual talk to someon and go through the materi togeth
i can engag with the materi and ask question as they aris and not after
i rare have onlin class but when i do i find them engag
connect to other student and the instructor
you can easili stop the video it is easier to understand it
allow me to actual interact with the professor as most of the record lectur are from perviou year
you yourself choos when to do it as long as it is done befor the deadlin im alway abl to contact the instructor via phone or email if i need to
easi to follow whenev i feel like it
becaus i can organ my time in a more effici way i can take note better and if i have problem i can ask the professor at ani time
can studi the way i learn best
easier to learn the topic when it is explain so i don’t have to teach myself
it resembl most the class we had befor the pandem situat
it is help for them to explain fulli instead of just be given a textbook and note to take
more motiv to actual do the work becaus discuss hold me account
i have all the resourc need for my work at my dispos and i am not constrict to ani time period within which i have to be onlin for and thu cannot do ani other work
no choic of procrastin if watch record lectur then
more direct contact with expert i can get into the materi more easili
feel closest to normal
becaus i can look through at my own pace
it give a break from read and allow for passiv learn for a moment in lectur professor will often phrase or explain consept in a more oral and often time more understand way
you can rewind
i can ask question in real time while the professor is explain
i feel like i learn most from human interact rather than textbook
thi is our onli method 🤷‍♀️
i get easili distract in a live lectur when conduct onlin
it mean that i can do the lectur in my own time and i find thi the easiest to follow
becaus it is so much easier and faster to understand at least the gist of a lesson when on zoom
the explan is clearer than on a type document it feel closest to normal educ in the classroom it is familiar i can focu on it better
i can get the work done on my own schedul
i can get as close to a normal lesson as possibl i can interact with the teacher and the rest of the classor those who turn up and i benefit from other student question that i may nt have thought to ask
record lectur allow you to go back over content you have missedhelp to understand in more detail
help me to understand better
becaus it veri difficult to teach yourself content
can access it at whatev time i want
more interact and make me engag better
mean i actual have to do it becaus i am on a call
i work better in engag set becaus i get easili distract especi when i am at home
the access when it is flexibl to you when you’r studi your undergrad but also commit to other train etc it is much easier to access
ask question and have the teacher explain in a way that would normal make sens in the classroom
i like to have time to consid what is be said and have the flexibl to rewind part
it easier to understand the topic and ask question about the topic
the abil to rewind and listen to explan over is realli help and it’ gener more detail than if the slide are given alon
more straight to the point
i can ask question directli to the teacher
do class live felt the most familiar to me becaus it felt like i wa in the classroom
most similar to normal school class
you can watch lectur in your own time
faster and easier to learn the program
you can manag your time more effici
becaus i need to be there at a certain time which give me structur in my day on top of that it give the great opportun to ask question live and get to hear the question of everbodi els
it is much easier for me to stay organis and keep all of the upload materi organis
it’ the best way to get a discuss go and is more time effici as class are conduct at the regular time forc some normal upon student at the begin it wa quit hard with all the emot turmoil but as the day went by we need some of our regular old life back
it’ easier to ask question right away rather than text my lectur
live class would be a lot more product and motiv me to do more with the materi like real life lectur usual do
becaus i think that way will make me postpon watch the lectur less
abl to easili ask question
more interact got a reason to get out of bed in the morn a chanc to actual talk to someon as i live alon
have live meet keep me account and more engag in class if the lectur is record i can push it off until anoth time but if it’ in real time i need to go and be present
give some of my friend who aren’t social confid the chanc to feel comfort when give input
work at own pace
becaus i can ask question and interact with my classmat and teacher
it’ easier to ask question as they aris rather than note them down after the record lectur
it allow you to talk directli to your lectur the closest thing to real uni
more engag and better abl to answer question
we can interact with the teacher directli and ask question as soon as we have some which is not the case for record lectur
i chose live class becaus all student get engag with the teacher they will also have an easier time ask question
interact with professor
you’r held more account to turn up and not be lazi about it also help to maintain a unilik structur
i studi histori and a big part of normal class is the discuss of our literatur with classmat and the professor thi is somewhat possibl in live class
the freedom of organis your day howev you like it is quit refresh
the teacher can explain concept student can interact ask question and do group work
it’ easier to ask question and make sure that you understand the work set
you can repeat passag or rewatch the whole lectur
it’ easier to engag with the professor and ask question directli howev most of my class are seminar for lectur i prefer record video
allow for question to be ask
more interact it also creat a routin to my day upload i can do whenev
it easier to particip and ask question
i can watch it whenev i want to
it is good to see all my fellow cohort and is more engag and motiv me to continu learn
would give me more incent to work
feel more like school abl to ask question with a quick respons
it more interactiv
becaus i’m abl to actual see and talk to peopl from outsid of my household and it’ more engag than just be sent an email or messag
it is easier to understand concept
i’m a visual learner
i think it’ more benefici to be abl to ask teacher question and more like a classroom set
becaus it allow me to work more at my own pace
becaus i can control the moment to watch it and i can stop it whenev i want to check an info or for my person note
the discuss is much more interest than the lectur
i do some spanish class so live class are the onli way to practic speak with the other member of the class
videocal are a wast of my time we don’t learn anyth
you can do everyth on your own pace and xatch back certain segment
becaus it take less time than the actual lesson and you decid when you do it the lesson take up a lot of time
becaus i am less pressur compar to live class i can process the task alon and deliber tackl them in accord to my own strategi as long as i submit accordingli on the deadlin
i find that by discuss idea with peer it help me to consolid the inform more
most interact and give you the most valuabl experi closest to what you would normal experi i feel like engag is easier to measur and focus’ my attent more than record lectur
interact
it is way more engag
becaus i am a fine art student mean onlin teach is veri hard and anyth other than a discuss wouldn’t be valuabl to my educ
we had some live class but the teacher didn’t realli teach in them they were just there to answer ani question about the work we had been set so i prefer uploadedemail materi becaus it allow me to get on with my work without wast time on a call
easili abl to interact and ask question
becaus you can follow the content at prefer amount of time while it is person present and discuss by the professor that a good way of learn for the lectur class
pure becaus you have a chanc to speak to a tutor directli
becaus i love to be engag in a convers and discuss which is for me the best form of learn
you can engag with the professor
i am abl to paus lesson and go back to make note if necessari i prefer have written and auditori inform
it work around when i have time to do thing doesn’t requir me to be at a desk at a certain specif time
if i have question need to be answer there is an immedi respons
it’ easier to ask ani question
as it requir constant attent
live class give the student the opportun to ask question and request addit explan when need although i think that a mix between live class and record lectur work as well
becaus it’ live you’r gonna ask more question and also it feel like i’m in class with everyon which i love
becaus i can do it at my own speed
more interact forc particip
i can talk to peopl if i need help but there is no oblig to talk
interact with other student and teacher
i can ask live question and thing can be explain if we don’t understand you can ask them to slow downspe up
so i can come back and watch it again and i don’t have to be there watch where i becom realli disengag
more interact and make me have to go the work
we got to watch the lectur that were record last year but to me it feel like the lectur spent less time on the cours howev we got to ask question dure gta session which made it more person too
less awkward that surround onlin class
still interact
live class give me anxieti so record video are the best option for me
abl to ask lectur question straight away can benefit from other student contribut rais moral
be abl to ask question and get answer right away
the abil to rewind and take in a lectur at my own pace
be abl to interact with professor make all the differ for me
it the easiest way to understand thing
even though i’m current be given email and worksheet like materi i would prefer to pursu to onlin class they are much more effici as you can do question when you do not understand bit of the work
as the lectur is explain well in a vid and i can paus anytim to listen again the internet can be adjust unlik the zoom meet where it could be unstabl
vital for understand need to be abl to ask question in real time and hear the explan
it’ becaus i would actual be taught what i’m tri to learn by a teacher rather than me attempt to understand it and teach myself
i find it more engag and also is a lot easier to ask question instead of email back and forth which can take a while
can get it done when i want and at my own pace
i am abl to ask my professor question in real time while they are go through the materi rather than have to email them after watch a prerecord lectur
more interact that other type
easier to stay on top of my work
more interact and engag also keep the social interact aspect of class
my subject is practic and i get to danc and see and still learn without a studio

so i can work through the materi at my own pace
allow similar contact with teacher and is more interact

i feel there’ a limit amount that a teacher can do and help in an onlin lesson which is whi i prefer get to grip with emailedupload materi
it veri similar to usual class and u can ask the teacher directli henc they can understand ur question clearer and respond in full detail wherea other in mode you cant ask them or there a higher chanc of misunderstand what the other person is say or not understand at all
it leav me with more independ to complet the work on my own timescal
interact with teacher

live call encourag more engag with the content
becaus you can actual interact with each other and ask question much more person
i find it easier to stay focus thi way
struggl to teach myself
i find it more engag
it give my day structur if there is class at 9am i have to be up at 9am to join and cannot sleep in
in thi mode i am abl to paus the video or go back when i didn’t understand someth in thi way i don’t have to go over my note and write them neatli after the lesson but can do it while work on the video
it is more interest with less technic difficulti
make it similar to in person lectur that i’m use to
i feel as if it give me a better understand of the topic
it’ easier to ask my teacher question and get answer to thing that i’m struggl with
i find it easier to understand concept and engag with the materi when have interact with other student and my lectur particularli in subject such as scienc when it can be veri complex
i think where it is all so new when we have had ‘live’ stuff it ha just not be veri well prepar wherea record lectur seem much more like normal realiti for me as all our lectur are record ani way
easier to understand when someon is talk through it
becaus be in a zoom meet replic the classroom environ the most
can watch in your own time more inform
becaus it is easier to understand the content we are suppos to be learn in discuss
most interact and engag
more interact and explan are a lot easier to follow
live is more interact than prerecord

can do it in my own time and routin
less lone and more engag
i am abl to work in my own pace
closest thing to face to face teach
engag more with content abil to ask question see cours mate
it motiv me becaus i actual have to be there and i can ask question
more interact with the teacher rather than just email back and forth

more interact and engag
can do in own time and paus to work through
i like watch video and make note the visual represent help with my understand
more person interact and can offer more guidanc
becaus the student will have enough time to focu on what the prof say and therefor ask meaning question live class are similar to a classroom where we often think we understood all of the concept but when we revis them we find that we lack a lot of deep understand
you can go at your own pace and do your own kinda thing
there is an abil to interact with the teacher and other student
can be rewatch at a time that suit rather than interrupt my studi schedul with a live class
it still provid the structur of have class at a specifi time wherea prerecord lectur requir me to structur my own time which i find more difficult
it veri help to be abl to ask the teacher question directli
make me abl to paus the video to think and write if need
it’ the closest to a real class environ and i like the discuss and feedback element of learn which you can’t get from email with worksheet attach
more interact
it bring more structur in daytoday life and allow interact although my own attitud is rather passiv it still feel more like an collabor rather than a talk encyclopedia
more engag more interact make you concentr help from other peopl
becaus eit allow you to interact with the instructor and immedi ask question when you need to

it feel more independ and allow me to chose how i dedic my time to studi dure lockdown
it’ easi to follow and you can ask the teacher if you have a question
i can fit in my work with my day and it make thing easier to prioritis as oppos to be fix to be onlin for a certain time which may not alway be appropriateavail to me
more interact and abl to commun more easili
conveni if you have other prioriti
i can complet in my own time
i feel like i learn a lot more by have to work through it in my own time without the pressur of sit in live lectur all day
the live class help me stay motiv and engag with the materi i found that if i wasn’t be forc to pay attent i often didn’t and would simpli do the assign just to complet the cours and not learn anyth
acces
becaus i can do the work around famili life do the work when it suit me best rather than stick to a timet in colleg
you are abl to rewatch it and in a record lectur you can listen and read more sens are use
it is more engag i still have a structur day
becaus it give you the foundat to go and find resourc or inform yourself without have to reli on group work or contribut in an onlin seminar
you gat immedi respons to ani question you have
feel like i actual have to do the work instead of put it off for age
i can paus the video ani time and then skip thing or revis other topic again easili
more comprehens inform can alway email the lectur ani question inclus to those in differ time zone
thi is actual the onli mode my school is use and i can ask question directli to my professor
becaus i get to refer back to them later and complet work rather than be sat listen to a teacher
it elimin time zone issu but still allow the instructor to talk with student written out instruct can be harder to understand
it allow me to work at my own pace without pressur of contribut but if i have a question i can alway email the teacher
less chanc of tech issu
feel it is more insight and relev to the topic i have one teacher that follow thi method and feel like my knowledg is more secur than in my other subject as a result
you can creat a connect with your teacher and ask question and it’ the most similar mode to common class
as much as interact is import in a time like thi is myself and other student don’t enjoy the idea of be on screen with other classmat and our lectur thi is the person prefer for mani in my cours as it also allow us to studylearn when the time is right for us also
it is quit easi to use thing such as zoom but i often find it a wast of my time i would much rather just be told my assign in a paragraph form
live cours
easi to follow
closest to be a real teach set
more interact with other student and teacher more social connect
it like have instant feedback if i had a question and just like commun face to face
can engag in convers with other student and the teacher record lectur are often from the 201819 academ year
more interact with the teacherprofessor and it more engag
zoom isn’t alway product peopl can be more shi that they usual would in a seminar
interact and at a set time
interact with teacher and other student abil to speak and ask question in real time even if everyon is work on an assign
can go at my own pace
the interact natur of thi mean that i am abl to ask question when they aris
as my onlin lecturevideo are onlin and aren’t live i’m abl to choos when i want to watch a video and take note thi is prefer as be at home mean i get so much more distract than at uni so be abl to work around my day and plan when i want to watch lectur is perfect for me
we can use live chat at the same time and get instant feedback
it allow for interact with professor and other student it almost as normal as be in a classroom
more interact and engag
becaus i get to express my opinion and it’ easier to boost my grade thi way
it interact
no pressur for time you learn in your own time
conveni if you have other prioriti
i am more of a hand on learner and watch record video is somewhat help but have the professor explain me be abl to ask question on the spot and see and hear what he is do help more than a video
becaus you can ask question and communicati with classmat
i’m not veri good at schedul myself so i like the fact that somen els ha made a timet for me
more engag
abil to paus to make sure you can understand the content
more interact with teacher make me more engag and i understand content and can ask question on stuff if unsur
allow me to engag with teacher and other pupil
most similar to in person lectur
give me time to paus take good note and check the book
to send in assign via email
it’ just like befor covid but with a screen between everyon it also give me the chanc to ask question immedi
thi is so that live discuss and better commun can happen
can do at anytim
no time constraint and simpl to complet
i think interact with teacher and fellow classmatesfriend is a crucial factor in learn and with school be close dure the pandem replic thi interact via live class and video chat for me maintain the level of interest in the subject itself and ani question or queri can be answer immedi as oppos to wait for an email respons x
opportun to ask questionsclarifi thing from record lectur insight into how to answer exam
due to time differ between the student in my class i find that mani peopl are inact dure live lecturesseminar i have found a combin of the two the most affect a record lectur when possibl and a short live discuss
it is far more engag when i can actual interact with my professor in real time facetofac
it easier to learn through interact you can ask question etc
easili understand
live speak is better
i like to interact with the teacher they can help you with difficulti when need
get to directli ask my supervisor question
as you can ask question and seek explan in real time
the instruct are clear and it is the closest thing to a normal lesson without ani technic issu
it easier so ask question and have them answer in real time dure a lectur
everybodi get a chanc to say someth
you can watch it multipl time
best to focu
allow interact but not face to face on camera at a certain time that might not work with time zone
it awkward have live interact with teacher
i have my teacher there to fulli explain each concept but i can go at my own pace and speed up or rewind the video as need
you can do the work in your own time i feel like you are learn more process a larger quantiti of inform
i do not like the time constraint of call or discuss board in thi hectic time
otherwis i will not concentr on the other mode nor use them well do the live class mean i have to be present also give some routin a reason to get out of bed
it is effektiv but not as time consum as the other method in comparison to eg chat it is also fair for studuent with slow internet who cant particip in the discuss properli
you can still hear the teacher explain the materi and can ask question
i can access record lectur anytim so will not set suffici time to actual listen to them wherea live class are set at specif time so i can organis my time better also i can have discuss with the professor in live class
i’m get the experi of be taught but also be abl to access it at my own time
there is less pressur
more like in class
veri interact teacher can also record the call to post it later for those who werent abl to join or so we can watch it again
it is interact and offer the possibl to ask question it is also the closest to actual class and give the feel of be with other student instead of studi complet on your own
i can work at my own pace
mean i can customis my own learn and do it at my own pace i get the most out of what i am given with time to do extra opportun for uni applic
we havent had anyth differ for me to gain anoth prefer but we have had record lectur sinc the begin of my degre i’m a second year and they work realli well as you can paus the lectur and speed upskip anyth you want our lectur are also alway avail to email in a question you have from the lectur
i can follow them at ani hour of the day i am kind of a night person
becaus i feel like i can engag the most with peopl it not as invis so i have to do my work
ask live question
strict routin more similar to normal teach
it could be a suffici and interact way to replac the face to face lesson as the teacher can show the class materi while explain at the same time
live class are my prefer mode of teach becaus discuss and question are possibl i feel like i understand more of the topic also i am much more motiv to actual prepar for the class if i have live class
we onli have upload video but i’d prefer some form of live teach to be abl to ask live time about the lesson
i would prefer if my school did live class
interact more
i am abl to ask question whilst the content is be taught mean that i am less like to be confus when it come to ani work given to us it also allow student to still give present particip in group work etc which i realli enjoy as it allow me to look at the inform in a differ way compar to exam question for exampl
i feel it can be more access as with internet connect it is neccesari but not as much as in live class and it also give more space for the student to revis the materi in their own way it is more flexibl and less heavi than sit two hour listen to a person
forc me to actual watch the lectur give structur etc
it feel like you’r in the lesson becaus you can hear your teacher’ voic and ask ani question right then and there as oppos to do the set work independ
more engag less easili distract
i find that record lectur are best for me becaus i can studi at my own pace ani time of the day and i can paus the recordingvideo if i don’t understand someth and search for answer somewher els
i can paus the video if i dont underst the concept or if im take note
i find it easier as i prefer more independ studi
best way to manag my time
it’ the easiest way to help understand the work becaus you can review it as mani time as you like
it feel more person and i would like to tri it as upload work feel more lone
you can rewatch it
you can watch at your own pace so you actual learn more
keep my attent and give a feel of social contact and interact to an extent
becaus i don’t alway have the opportun to watch live class
too scare to ask question
so that i can watch it and take note at my own pace
easier to engag
email materi
i can go at my own pace while not feel the pressur of answer in a live class i can ask question via email to my teacher without feel nervou or embarrass
it much more interact we can connect and commun with our teachersclassm
becaus i can watch it faster and whenev i want to
interact instant repli
it mean i can work through them in my own time and at a pace where it doesnt overwhelm me
work at own pace
ask question and get the answer explain ‘in person’ lead to have a much better understand of the topic
more interact and allow to ask question
you can watch it whenev you want and the teacher can explain the topic in depth
more engag and easier to ask question
the lectur can explain further on question
be abl to talk directli with the teacher and student in the call would be veri similar to how it work when we were in the classroom be more time effici when it came to not understand the content and make thing seem more normal
your learn is independ and can be suit to fit around whatev your athom situat is
more engag and easier to clarifi inform
i can do it in my own time
can plan my time and when i want to do everyth
i don’t want to be live with my class becaus i’m so stress about be call on that i don’t actual learn anyth so by have a record lectur i can actual learn at my own pace without the stress of be live
it allow for me to be abl to access the materi at a time that is most suitabl to me i think thi realli cater to student with learn disabl or care duti that find it difficult to attend live class i also think the abil to paus and go back over materi as mani time as need is a big advantag i find the flow of lectur extrem fast pase and struggl to keep up with the inform so thi mode of learn is perfect
closest to be taught by someon but without the distract of a live class
engag a certain time to do the work
it the most similar to normal class so it wa the easi to adapt in thi situat
it’ more interact and provid the need social interact through the lockdown
you can ask question while the lectur is ongo
i think i can better understand the topic when it explain by our professor as in live class especi if it is a new subject which we didnt cover yet
allow for discuss and new inform
it’ realli easi to follow
you can interact with the teacher as if you were in the physic lectur
it feel like i’m actual in a lesson and forc me to be product
more interact with the professor and other classmat
becaus it easier for me to concentr on studi when i have thing to read instead of listen to also live class are hard at home most of the time there someth happen around which make it even harder to concentr so it easier if i can just choos the time i studi
as learn at home is a veri differ environ to learn in colleg it take a longer amount of time for me to actual understand the work and complet the task and so email them upon complet is much easier and also due to my home environ it would be hard to sit there and be involv in a live virtual class for exampl
i find it easier to follow it also stop me from get as distract
i studi a veri practic and collabor cours
becaus i can studi at the time that i want to studi
i believ record lectur allow an individu to view and learn at their own schedul as a high schooler who also prepar for independ uni exam for a drama theatr degre i found it difficult to reconcil both studi ex my morn ballet class would overlap with my ap what more have some lectur record would help in revis or understand the topic better after watch it multipl time have access to those and be abl to commun with the professor for ex on chat would be my prefer mode
it deliv the fact in a direct way
have a teacher to explain everyth but have flexibl to structur your day as you want which you cant do with live class
allow for the best engag and an opportun to ask question etc it is as close to the learn pre covid addit it is the most product in fact more so than the situat pre covid and in person learningfac to face teach
much more engag abil to ask question
can do it in my own time
better engag requir you to stay more engag
record lectur allow more flexibl they can be paus rewind zoom is closer to a classroom experi but just feel unnatur and ha similar disadvantag to real life teach such as not be abl to look back on it if it’ not record etc
most similar to face to face teach without the pressur of be live on a call
when it’ live you have to do be in front of your comput and you can’t postpon the lesson it keep me more motiv becaus now i left everyth until the veri last moment and need to do everyth in a few day to be readi to studi it by heart
feel the most like school and the materi is best understand with an explan
flexibl work with my schedul
becaus it allow for time to explain the materi ask question and clarif as well as discuss among the class
the abil to work whenev i want without have to be in class when i have other assign to get done
can talk to tutor
becaus it allow me to take the best note and learn the most from the cours
i can studi at a time i prefer the most also when do homework and assing it is easier to find help to those from lectur note or other upload materi rather than from live or video lectur
becaus im with my famili at home and dure live class i cant particip properli in the class becaus of the nois
allow to have your own schedul specif if you have other respons
becaus you can do it whenev you want
can ask question directli and gener thing are explain better than just note
i can watch whenev i want and can organ myself much better
most engag
recreat the experi of tutori better
i found live onlin class to be veri stress as there were mani factor that could go wrong ie wifi issuesrun out of batteri or get interrupt
i think i would engag in the work more
actual it’ a mixtur of life class and record lectur the best class so far have been those that offer record video to teach the content offer practic sheet and then follow up with a weekli meet to answer question or go into more depth
hard to keep concentr in live class
it’ way more person and easier for student to receiv instruct it’ the closest to normal in person class
for onlin lesson i feel like i have to sit there and listen for the entir durat of the lesson and so i therefor actual do the work but when teacher onli upload work and question i never bother do them
it resembl the tradit seminar to the best it can
it creat a sens of engag and you dont feel like a work machin
it wouldnt lag and i can alway refer back to the lesson
i feel like we would be abl to interact with lectur more and ask question as we haven’t had ani onlin seminar so we’v onli been abl to ask question through email which take 3 work day for a repli
more interact and it doesn’t make it as easi to switch off and get distract
it is the most engag and help
i’m abl to have a similar experi to an actual lectur but at the convinc of alway have access
can take my time
more engag
i think thi is most similar to the physic class you feel quit engag depend on teacher and cours you can immedi get answer to your question you can join discuss and learn from what other peopl are say ask
i can go back and check if i have ani doubt
thi would be my prefer mode in combin with email materi becaus thi is the best way to discuss
becaus it is closest to an actual class my uni ha current just email us signpost read alreadi there rather than do someth to compens the class we’v miss
becaus it is the most similar to a “normal” class and you can clear your doubt and get feedback from the teacher
can ask question real time feedback
i can keep a normal studi rhythm and adk question directli i love discuss
it’ easier to motiv myself to do it feel like i’m not alon in do it and you get instant feedback from teacher and other student
live interact with the lectur
i can listen to the audio more than onc there is enough time to make note and professor make sure that we can ask question
it would be more easier to follow and i can ask question on the topic i don’t understand
i can understand better what were learn as it is explain
becaus it funni
it give me a chanc to receiv immedi feedback and contact with anoth human be it also give more structur to my week my class are pretti much 50 live and 50 upload materialsassign and the latter are definit more stress becaus i have to organ my time on my own and it feel like im learn less becaus it mostli just me answer question and write essay
more interact and i’m more engag with the learn
i can organ my own schedul and rewatch the topic that i find most difficult
i person like have someon who explain thing and also give some background inform if ask
forc me to interact with materi less like to procrastin
you can go through materi at your own pace
give most opportun for interact with teacher and class
make me keep to a schedul
easi to access when you want
you can actual still talk to the teacher and not have to wait a week for a repli to an email
i find it’ more interact and i am abl to commun my question in a more detail level with my teacher i also feel it replic a natur classroom environ the most
easier to understand and ask question
i can decid on the amount and time i want to work on my assign
it easi and comfort
most interact and interest
we get to do work in our own time
it requir student to studi and understand the materi beforehand then come to the discuss and have the professor and other classmat fill the gap in the knowledg
becaus it explain it better without have the pressur or awkward of live chat
becaus i could watch the class at anytim and whenev i wa free howev with onlin live class i had to be awak everyday by 730 am in order to attend them on time
becaus i can learn at my own pace and replay the part i find most difficult
be abl to interact and ask question instantli rather than be all on your own
becaus it give me a schedul
i find myself to be more product as there is less time to chat and faf about
interact see the person
becaus when it come to live session sometim i do not feel motiv wherea find my own time to watch is better
i learn most effici when i’m on my own and at my own speed
becaus i have enough time to understand everyth and i can paus whenev i want
it take a while to hear from staff and thi would be a faster way to clarifi ani concern
allow you to engag with other and also forc you into a routin
becaus it give me time to learn at my own pace and to stop and go back if i am distract dure the first attempt of watch it
i find it hard to concentr and stay motiv in a livestream where the the doctor read a pp
live interact be abl to engag in real time
it’ more direct and engag mimic in person the most
it’ the most like normal school
most interact
it allow you to go back and review the materi and work at your own pace
allow me to ask question more easili
less technic glitch and as student mostli get talk at rather than interact with their professor in my uni i think the record lectur are super handi to paus and write note at my own pace
becaus you have to be listen all the time as teacher can ask you question that you need to answer and less easi to get distract and more interest and easier to understand content wherea if they’v email you the work you can do it in your own time and have break easili and difficult to teach yourself
email
i can go through the lectur at my own pace paus etc if i have ani question i can alway email my professor and ask for an individu tutorship
you’r held account you need to join at a specif time and contribut oral to discuss it’ veri easi to put off look at upload resourc so thi make sure i do work
my school offer no other choic except email work for my subject
becaus i could feel more comfort as well as learn almost as if in my normal environ inperson
it allow me to interact with my professor more freeli and to gain a better understand of the materi be taught
i think that video teach a lesson would be help even if they are short so it could further explain what we are do and what is requir of us especi in subject like math
it keep me account and i am abl to ask question in real time
i can then easili divid my time the way i want to
i can take note at my speed paus thing re watch thing if i did not understand the concept the first time
it possibl to paus and relisten or do extra research in part that i dont understand or need more inform on
i think is the closest substitut to physic lectur
you can work with the email materi at your own pace
they allow for a lot of flexibl but they are not as interact as live class on the other hand they are great for lectur where mani peopl particip in
becaus i can paus the video when i want to take note and if i didnt understand someth or hear it then i can replay it
i am abl to ask question i have at the time and have an immedi respons unlik when get work then email for a respons
it feel most similar to usual class and also is more interact in isol it’ also a realli nice social gather and we can ask question if we need to
it give more structur to my day and reflect normal uni life
i can take note at my own pace it seem more person like teacher still care
thi method ensur that i am be present and activ dure my class
you can’t skip through the content you have to sit there for whoeber long the class is
allow me to listen to music while studi i don’t need to watch a lectur and can instead have it in note form
i feel uncomfort be on a video call with my class teacher
becaus i can stop the video listen to sth again and watch it whenev i want
becaus the materi is explain in a better way and if you have a question you can ask it and get a respons right away
as i can follow at my own pace and can skip ahead if i feel i understand or i can paus to copi down examplestri and understand more while still have it explain by my lectur instead of just use the note i cannot fulli say whether i would prefer live class as i onli have 1 zoom session a week for 1 cours as not everyon at our univers ha equal access to data even though all student have been provid with data live session use up a lot more data than type note or video transcript and not everyon ha workingliv condit where they can access a session at a specif time thi mean that we are provid with type note and the record lectur are option but it make it hard for me to decern whether i prefer live session due to the fact that our univers doesnt recommend their usag
becaus it’ just like be in an lectur and it’ record so can paus and play
i like to be abl to do it in my own time
more interact
i’m more flexibl with my job in a supermarket
although they are live all student are on mute and no video so it’ just the lectur you can hear and see as the lectur can’t see me i get so distract easili by my phone and famili life dure time i should be focus also there are lot of tangent that wouldn’t be in a normal lectur we have also lost a lot of contact hour my degre is quit practic anim biolog and when my uni have tri to modifi practic for us to do at home it seem pointless and i don’t engag with it veri well
i’m a visual learner
it’ the most interact method with the opportun to ask ani question there and then plu you need to make an effort to remain focus
caus when lesson are live i can easili ask my teacher question concern the lesson
most of my class are discuss base so thi allow for those discuss to continu also thi seem the best option for languag cours
easier for teacher to explain it to you in person make me go less crazi by see other peopl
live class
i am abl to listen to record as i write my note paus and go back when i need to and i can listen to them whenev i want
it is more similar to the usual way cours are taught at my univers
becaus it keep student more account and engag with the coursework
it is interact and more involv
it is more person and better explain than upload materi but often work better than zoom sinc the lectur seem to be more comfort
it save time no small talk like we would have dure live class and you can do it whenev you want
more interact which forc you to be more present
you‘r abl to take note while listen becaus you’r abl to press paus
becaus you can understand the explan in a more visual way
i find it daunt onlin with other student and i’m afraid to speak out
more interact
becaus the lesson can be record mean if i don’t understand the first time or the pace is too quick i can go back and paus at necessari point of the lesson
becaus i could take note at my own pace on my own time somewher comfort
you get to know your professor and can actual see them it nice to get some structur for your day when meet are schedul you cant postpon them
onlin class can get bore when there is no interact
interact is more benefici and engag
can ask question
it give you the space to go in you own term and time
i can work at my own pace stop to research someth when i don’t understand it or when someth interest me i can spend more time on it
becaus if it’ record i can rewatch it and stop it when i need to
the teacher are abl to explain theori and concept which i find to be more effect than simpli read and make note from textbook
i can do it in my own time but i also have vocal interact
the most interact out of the option
i just like have inform that i can pull up on a tab and flick between note and thing like that to complet the task just work for me😂
becaus i can decid when i want to listen the lectur and i can listen to it more than one time
becaus i can actual talk to the teacher in real time and it feel more like normal school
more interact feel more motiv and the lesson are more engag if it’ a live class
it’ much more valuabl t mo hear other people’ idea and to be abl to ask your teacher more question more easili
more interact
becaus you get to interact with your prof and your pupil ask relev question and are motiv to contribut to the cours
it’ the most instant and i can actual ask for help
i can plan my time better and watch the video in a faster speed
i like to be abl to paus and take note at a reason pace but also have a direct set by the professor and materi taught i struggl to effici self teach
you have to show up to the class it help to stay a bit more motiv
more interact can get answer to question quicker better understand as can collabor with peer
lectur abl to interact in realtim and far more engag form of learn
becaus i can do it whenev i want unlik a zoom call and it is more than just a pdf it is more interact with a video
becaus it is veri similar to an actual class in which we are there
it give you direct feedback
i think i can get on with my work as i do it in a much shorter time than if a teacher were to send video of them talk through itdo live class also i prefer to plan my own schedul in the week and stick to a teacher would be veri tediou in my opinion
you can paus to take note and it is time flexibl
i enjoy school becaus of the interest academ interact i get to have with my peer and my teacher
faster to make note and understand
it’ easier to understand when somebodi actual explain it verbal
more interact it feel like i know what i’m do more and there’ a form of guidanc
forc you to particip at the right time
give you time to write down note and you aren’t limit by ani connect problem which sometim interfer when the teacher is tri to present inform in live lesson
more interact with teacher and colleagu
becaus i can’t get away from do them at that exact moment so i procrastin less they are also not old record lectur from last year like some of my professor do so while teach live they can keep in mind which situat we are in
becaus it provid the most connect even if get distract or space out a fair amount i benefit a lot from the sens of togeth and support i get from live class even at the time when they are not veri engag in addit to thi are the discuss that organ happen dure live class between the student and the professor which would not happen if we all just studi materi individu
an easier way to commun ask question and be engag through a zoom class googl meet etc
upload document don’t explain thing fulli but i don’t want to feel constrict by have to attend zoom class dure thi anxiou time so prerecord lectur would be a perfect mixtur of both
do it at own pace
closest to a real class abl to ask and be ask question to test understand also stop me from spend too much time on class work as i know to stop when the lesson end and work on other thing
i can ask my teacher immedi after a question aris
so i know i understand the content rather than just memoris fact after fact
i can studi the materi at my own time without ani pressur
time to paus and take note is avail
you can ask question and get live explan
we weren’t abl to have thi but i feel that if we had zoom call i would’v had more of a structur thu feel more motiv

there is more interact between teacher and student and it feel like be in school it help me stay more focus on my work
becaus i can be activ and if i have ani doubt i can just ask and don’t have to email my professor they don’t have a high respons rate
thi make it feel at least a bit more real life educ the record lectur feel like im give teach myself educ while with the real life lectur thi all self approach is less present
feel like you are there more engag
we were abl to engag the onlin class didn’t support ask question well
becaus we’r abl to discuss the topic and the associ work with a teacher to fulli understand it as we would in a classroom person i find it challeng when we just have to figur it out ourselv
as it is interact and isn’t passiv so you concentr more
it is more effect in my opinion and it is avail for you to consult them whenev you want to
becaus you can have actual discuss about what you’r learn and thi help to develop a more in depth understand of the topic
easier to interact with teacher and other student
we are still learn as we would in normal learn but we can complet the work in our own time rather than be limit by schedul live class
more engag and can ask question and get an answer in real time
it is the one that resembl “normal classes” most
i struggl to concentr on onlinel class
more interact lectur are abl to help you as you work and you get to see your classmat which motiv me more
you can learn the subject at your own tempo
be abl to hear see what i’m learn at the same time help me retain inform better
i can paus the lectur to take note
becaus even though commun is limit it better to have an output possibl as oppos to just input through eg record lectur
becaus i can rewatch the class over and over again and make the note with timeee follow me on lucasnot
becaus immedi interact is possibl and it give the feel of reallif class
i come from a busi school were class are veri much like in secondari school and not so much like lectur so to me use zoom or other similar platform wa the most similar to ‘real’ class
becaus it’ the most similar one to regular classroom and i can ask directli question
i can work at my own pace and not get distract by other
less reason to procrastin mean i have quick revis video to watch for each topic i genuin wish my colleg did it so badli
clear up confus of content and allow for better understand question can be answer straight away which is much more conveni
it is more interact than record lectur becaus you are abl to ask question on the spot

i find it easier to follow what is be said and it keep me more focus
becaus it is a real time connect
own time and rhythm
more interact and interestingengag
upload materi
at least some ‘facetoface’ contact and you can ask question respond to other student it is not as ‘static’ it is the most collabor altern of atuni educ
i am abl to choos when i complet the activ
thi method give me the feel that i can get the most inform that i would usual get with physici class
i can digest the inform at my own pace and fit it around my schedul w famili respons
it help me understand the cours better
becaus it’ the most like be in a room with peopl
that way we can review it anytim we want it ha time flexibl as well
can ask question and have the teacher explain it properli
i enjoy live class as i am abl to interact with my teacher and peer
it is more interact and due to be in reason small class allow a deeper understand as i can ask question and get almost immedi respons
we get to connect with each other face to face which is extrem import at the moment with the lack of socialis and also remind you that your not the onli one go through thi
the materi is explain more access
can be done in flexibl hour
i can watch it whenev i want and how mani time i want
the inform is clearer when someon is explain it rather than read it from a document it is also easier to retain
opportun to ask question and is often more detail than upload materi
i like do it at my own pace and i struggl to focu for 2h dure onlin class
allow for more interact between tutor and peer
you can watch the lectur in your own time and fulli understand everyth
it would be nicer to see the face of my teacher when i learn
i’m a visual and auditori learner so thi is how i learn best studi obvious help my grade but i can mostli rememb thing from hear them from a teacher
make you more respons to show up for class it is more engag than watch a record lectur and direct feedbackinteract with peer and teacher
easier to revisit record materi with verbal explan
becaus it make student commun instantli and the most like to contact learn
allow the teacher to discuss what is be taught rather than have to do your own research and risk miss out on key issuestop
face to face commun
my subject are discuss base so be abl to talk about idea and hear other idea that i haven’t thought of is invalu
becaus i can replay the lectur sever time if i don’t understand a specif part also i don’t like to ask a lot of question dure the lectur i like to send the instructor privat afterward thu for me there are more pro than con in the record lectur
forc to focu for the set amount of time and it is timet
it easier to maintain the feel of real class by commun with each other live
easi to talk
engag with the teacher be abl to ask question while the teacher explain a topic no awkward email convers
as it hold you account to stick to a routin and keep on top of lectur instead of get behind on the pre record one
i am miss the one on one connect so it is nice to see and interact with classmat and the teacher
interact with professor
more engag and easier to keep a routin
i engag more and can’t ask question and am less like to not focu becaus i know i can’t go back
i can do it myself and i am not depend on wait for other to provid other rang of resourc
give me an account mechan to actual do the work set
live engag and time to ask question engag with classmat forc to be product give an aspect of schedul structur to your day
live class are often veri buggi and difficult to follow for the cours i take danc music theatr danc ap literatur i prefer to be sent read and work to do as it is more easili digest and less of a burden
interact and abl to ask question then and there
i feel like it give me more freedom to complet task
it’ as close to face to face teach you’ll get
i can listen to the class whenev i have the time for it also i can paus the video to take note and rewind if i havent understood someth
i am abl to rewatch until i understand
can do it at a time which suit you and can email your professor individu if you do not understand
so i find that i realli get distract with live zoom meet it is much easier to rewatch video later and thi mean i can watch them over more than onc too
i have the option to work whenev i want
i can access the materi in my own time and creat my own schedul when complet if work thi is benefici for me becaus i can be disciplin with myself
becaus i can pauserewind whenev i need to which make note take way easier
more inform and detail can ask for help
i am abl to access them whenev i have the time to
as i can work in my own time whilst still get input from teacher
zoom meet etc are hard on my anxieti
it’ more person and easier for teacher to answer question and help the student
have contact with teacher realli help me to understand the content they expect us to learn about
we can review lesson at ani time
interact set time instead of wherev which mean i actual end up do it
it allow me to paus and collect all the inform from the lectur that i requir without miss anyth
the class arentz explain
i could do it at my own timepac
the teacher can explain and it is a nice environ
i can watch it whenev i want even in the middl of the night and i can rewatch it when i forget someth
student can ask question directli to the lectur
more interact learn more more feedback less lone
i can watch it when i want and not at a set time
with live class we can still have thi “presenci class spirit” becaus everyon ha to be onlin at the same time we can discuss talk laugh and feel like we are togeth in some way with the other mode although they have their benefit i think they are the less “presencial” and less normal way they feel more lone
allow us to engag with the content and other student abl to ask the lectur question there and then
we use bongo at my uni and it’ great you see the professor you see the slide of the powerpoint as well and they can put in littl multipl choic question to see if the student understand the class plu we can chat in a group chat if we have ani question or we can chat one on one with a friend great platform i wish all my class would use it
it is easi to go back to the lectur video and make sure that you have understood everyth and afford the lectur more opportun to explain concept in detail
i can go at my own pace and not have to wait for the teacher to talk i can read through the document and take my own note if i have question i can alway send a quick email to my teacher
it’ more interact
it’ more interact and it give structur to my day
it’ the least time consum
more interact instead of passiv learn and can engag and ask more question
i can follow the lectur at my own pace
i like when the materi is spoken to me
best for understand
interact
you can start the day whenev you want
you can paus lectur which mean you can take in more info especi if lectur talk realli quickli also more suitabl becaus i dont have good wifi so live lectur are hard to access
polish is my second languag so i need some extra time to process everyth especi when i am at home and lack motiv to studi when we work with record lectur i can paus or replay certain thing
i find that have discuss with other peer and get their opinion on thing realli help to develop my learn when have to memoris a topic for an exam i find that if i have had an indepth discuss about it then i alway rememb it better for one of my subject just email materi like sheet to fill in and document to read have been the main mode of teach and i find that i do not learn anyth from do them for my other subject my teacher ha done record lectur which is good as i’m be talk through the materi howev i prefer be abl to have discuss with other student as they give me idea and new perspect on how to answer question and essay i would say that zoom would be the best for me howev i live in a hous with mani peopl which mean constant nois and distract and my wifi is realli bad so therefor i find zoom lectur pretti much imposs for me
it feel more like uni
becaus of the interact between the professor and student
i keep up with live lectur better than record lectur i am much less like to fall behind i also pay attent better in live lectur than record
better commun possibl and i actual get to see my class mate
most similiar to real teach in classroom
becaus i can go back to whatev it is that i might not understand or that will be help in the futur
in thi mode the materi is present at a more manag pace
it my prefer mode becaus we are interact with other clasmat
unfortun my school just sent email out to us at the begin of the week with a list of thing to do and didn’t teach us so i don’t have experi with zoom class howev one of my teacher sent out record of her voic along with a powerpoint which wa a lot more help and that is whi i choos that option as i can onli base my prefer of my experi
feel more like a normal familiar in person lectur
i can take in and absorb inform at my own pace
becaus i can listen to music and do work at my own pace
easi to discuss the learn subject
prefer learn from written inform
becaus it make me understand the lesson better
get to interact with the lectur live and you have to turn up at the right time
you can still see your classmat and discuss problem togeth
easier to work through
caus it like actual class like in school
activ engag with my small class size
can do it in my own time without too much pressur
i like be abl to do thing on my own time and i often look realli bad in the morn all of my teacher are also veri awkward on zoom so i never join them
it allow you to be taught the materi by the teacher while be abl to ask question live
it as close to facetofac lectur as we can get it great to be abl to have that contact with lectur in addit i think it encourag peopl to attend in comparison to prerecord lectur that you can access ani time
work is clearli set out within an email and if we need help we can email our instructor with ani question we had
becaus it make me studi when it live i actual prefer live class that are record for later revis
it’ the most flexibl and customis
everyon can share idea and opinion easili
becaus teacher tri to be more concis while record
a live class is the nearest altern to a physic class and when compar to read materi much more interact
more interact and commun feel less isol
becaus you can have live interact with the professor and classmat
becaus it is easier to understand the teacher it is possibl to ask question
i can do it on my own schedul
i can attend the class ani time dure the day not at specif time which let me plan my day to my wish
i prefer to work through thing by myself in my own time
video are interact without the connect issu that can come with zoom
it would allow me to listen to lectur when i have the time becaus dure quarantin i’m have to babysit and homeschool so i can’t alway join the call
you get to ask question and receiv an answer in the moment
more independ
the social aspect and interact
i can watch the lectur at a time that is best for me
it is the easiest for me to stay focus read all thi materi is just sometim impos and i can ask question imedietli while the lectur
i am abl to complet it in my own time howev it is less engag to not have other classmat around
i find it more organis
thi is more interact and the most close it can get to a physic offlin class
email work ha just caus me to becom complac and now i am constantli behind on work as teacher set more week each week
i can paus itslow downspe up ehich allow me to take it at my own pace and ensur i fulli understand everyth also mean i can take break also if i am in high product mode can get through a lot but if not less but eith timet session if i am not in a productivegood mood then it just tough luck
you can work on your materi in your own pace and whenev you want and there are no technic difficulti dure the live class had onli oke it wa hard to unterstand the teacher due to bad wifi or beleagu server sometim
give me more time to work at my own pace and reflect on the content
i can take my own time keep up with the materi of a subject and record lectur just dont get my attent i reli too much on the fact they are there whenev i need them so i let it accumul
i can ask question and have discuss with my peer to expand my understand
it’ easier to find import inform if you can replay the video or whatev they are use and also if someth need clarif or i didn’t understand it the first time i can just go back and listenwatch it again
it allow me to take time to make complet note and to go back if i didn’t understand a concept
you can interact with the lectur live time
it’ easier to take note and concentr
interact
i get to decid when i do it
less pressur as it is difficult to meet all expect and standard dure a global pandem i can watch when i am in the mindset to optimis my learn as an individu
the forum we’v been use for seminar make it so hard for discuss you have to wait a lifetim to type a question and hope to get a decent respons while there’ other convers go on and it’ super awkward wherea the zoom class i think have been make talk to my tutor and the discuss way more access
i can interact with my teacher in real time
i dont have the pressur of answer ani question live and i can also replay ani content i need repeat
i can watch them when i want
more engag
more like to actual do the work have to focu wherea upload document are veri easi to get bore with and not read give me someth to do in quarantin and is semisocialis
can just to do them at a time that suit
i find thi mode to be the best of both world between upload materi and live class with live class i get veri overwhelm becaus all focu is on the teacher and side convers are realli not a part of the class which is need sometim i also get tire of have to follow and understand what my teacher is say constantli especi when there no set time for the call to stop upload materi read especi are hard to focu on and comprehend so audio and visual content from my teacher realli help best of all i can go back if i miss inform in the video
it’ socialis as well as educ
some of my teacher teach pace is quit fast so i would prefer to pay the video to make sure i havent miss ani inform
it sort of mimic be in a lectur room which make studi easier caus you don’t have to teach it to yourself
becaus i prefer do the work whenev i want instead of schedul meet
i do better one someon is physic there to hold me account
more like the real thing get question answer straight away
ask question more motiv the most similar to normal inperson class
i can work at my own pace and figur thing out on my own while still have option to seek help if need
it feel that you in the class
it provid structur and the opportun to ask question directli plu i still have some interact with my peer
i learn better when i hear and see peopl explain thing
it’ the most interact and keep me motiv to follow the lectur
you get to interact and ask question
give structur to my week have timet lectur as normal and allow quick and easi interact with my lectur which help gain a deeper understand of thing i may struggl on
the class aren’t veri interact and isn’t the same qualiti of teach as it would be if it wa face to face
becaus i can paus it when need
i can ask question and i feel more like in a real class
we can ask the question directli
more interact abil to ask the teacher question in the moment
real time class
it is easier to engag with the lesson and ask clarifi question feel closest to an actual inperson lectur
i can do it without have to contact my teacher i realli like just get all the work on monday and do it without too much instruct
less interrupt
easi to ask question and fulli engag with the materi
can work at time that shit you best and can work at your own pace
look back
becaus my live class often did not work at all the qualiti and audio wa veri bad and the onlin explaining’ just don’t work for me
it allow to ask question and receiv answer in real timemor effici
i can activ ask question on a live lesson so that i actual understand
i can do it on my own time and at my own pace i prefer to work ahead whenev possibl
i’m in human so i like be abl to paus the video to take note or write down a veri specif word statement if i have question i email but when we were take class in person i would ask in class which i prefer to email
becaus there is the option to paus and replay if i don’t understand someth right away also i am more flexibl at what time i’m do the lectur
abil to ask question and get immedi feedback live lesson keep me account i have to attend the lesson and stay focuss dure the durat of the class
i prefer the interact you get and it’ easier to ask question and have thing explain to you there and then rather than wast time email
becaus i can go back to it when studi for final and that way i cant miss out ani class
we can actual learn thing from our teacher as they can explain thing wherea email materi don’t go in as well
more interact opportun for ask question and have discuss
more interact and use for feedback
it’ faster
i find them easier to engag with i often zone out and get distract whilst just do work email to me also it is far easier to get help when you get stuck
you can ask question and receiv immedi respons
help with understand to have teacher explain
i can watch it at my own pace
easi to decid yourself when to do what so that you can be more motiv for it
it’ similar to be in a class but without have the need for my wifi to kick everyon off for it to run
if there is someth you don’t understand you can go back and watch it again plu it’ conveni if you’r take note
a deeper understand that isn’t explain through powerpoint it feel more person and is easier to have a guid
get instruct from lectur engag
becaus it is a lot easier to engag with and comprehend the materi when hear someon explain it in an audibl way i also get the option to paus and go back if i don’t understand which you don’t get in live or in person class
my tutor doesn’t realli stick to a “work” base chat so i’m not learn at the moment but have someth record would mean my tutor would actual stay on task
zoom
it selfpac and i can access all the materi at ani time moreov i dont lose time due to technic or connect problem
becaus it the one that most resembl face to face class
it explain thing by a profession
watch record lectur is veri tediou bore and easi to get distract
it is the onli mode i experienc
my major is veri practiceori so live class are the place where collabor and discuss result in a deep dive into the concept
work with teacher in real time and are abl to ask question
it’ as close to actual facetofac contact you can gain in quarantin it’ much easier to bounc idea off of one anoth and ask question as soon as they come to mind
keep my attent can’t get distract
i like have the schedul tim to work easier to pay attent to the live zoom are record so you can listen to them at a differ time if you need to or if you want to go back an refer someth no one realli ask question in question but it’ nice to maintain the option onlin we haven’t been abl to incorpor the normal group discuss but zoom would allow for that
your abl to ask question live
it allow me to work at my own pace
my prefer wa a pre record lectur post befor the lesson time then dure the lesson time we would have a zoom where we could discuss and do group task in the break out room
most interact and person
can access at ani time
such class are live it is harder to motiv yourself to partak in work that is on blackboard and can be access at ani time of the day
as it is most similar to “normal” school and is the most effienct way for interact and feedback
no pressur of be put on the spot to answer question but still get taught the inform confidenti mail are also avail for if you have question
more interact
as it is most similar to “normal” school and is the most effienct way for interact and feedback
i take a live class through a seper program and it is much better in term of get to know your teacher and be abl to have live deep discuss on topic and also get to know your classmat who are from differ place than i and learn about their cultur their experi most importantli it give me mentor and classmat to grow with laugh with and live with
live class make ask question easier and allow teacher to focu on explain concept that the specif group of student find challeng
interact opportun for discuss and can ask question
i can paus becaus my instructor tend to talk faster than in class leav note for less time up
there is class engag and it help keep a wellstructur schedul for increas motiv to work
it the onli one ive experienc
forc time to show up
it is the most similar to actual be on campu as you have a sens of have proper contact with the lectur and it hold you account for attend the class and engag with the content
it feel the most like real lectur
it is more interact and the teacher can give instant feedback
you get instant feedback and for me it is more engag also it is nice to talk to peopl
becaus i get to know idea other than my own on a subject
more live contact
easier to ask question
it is the onli way you can truli interact with the teacher and schoolmat you are posit forc to activ particip in the discuss and pay attent
i’m enabl to work at my own pace in the way which are best for my learn style
i can organ my time individu
i can work at my own pace whilst still experienc be taught i like have a teacher there to conduct my studi
have onli experienc thi didnt like it much
you can interact with peopl even while distanc
live answer from the teacher
interact with teacher and student in real time is so valuabl in learn for me
i can paus the video to take note and absorb the inform as it come
it is most similar to normal class you learnt the materi in the same method and have the opportun to ask question and interact with classmat freeli
it’ more engag forc structur and mean you feel as if you are actual interact with human
be abl to see each other’ face and interact feel like actual progress rather than passiv learn
i am an audibl learner so i understand it better
it take more time but i can work at my own pace which i love
allow for quick respons from teacher and peer instead of have to wait for emailmessag back easier to engag in work and hold focu
i can stop it whenev i want
becaus i get to activ particip in class and get rid of ani doubt right away
i can go through thing at my own pace whilst maximis effici but also receiv the expertis of my teacher rather than just post materi to complet
interact
i can stop when i want the record if i didnt understood someth and that help me to end the lession with a complet and deep understand of what ive listen to
most contact i can ask question have live debat
becaus i can decid when i am go to do each homework i can manag myself
becaus it is the closest format that replic a « live class » and you actual get live human interact
it’ the most interact
i can ask question in the moment
allow us to ask question
it ha the teacher explain it howev i can do it whenev i want without have to be tie to a live call at a particular time
it is the closest we can get to be at school with teacher and is the best way to actual learn inform
it is the most similar to a normal class and avoid the awkward of onlin lesson i have found there is a struggl to have a valuabl discuss or debat in onlin lesson as social cue are dull so record lectur deliv the inform and the explan without that hinder i have found myself more regularli have the debat we would be have in class usual with the member of the class in an independ group chat where it is easier and more product to help each other and convey idea
more interact
learn at my own speed
as the thing i feel like i’m realli miss out on at the moment is class discuss and altern opinion especi as i know essay base subject
it the more similar to an inperson class and it easier to have interact with the professor
my wifi isn’t great at home and i have to fit learn around my famili
it make student account and feel more like a tradit class
more engag
you can skip back if need
more interact with the professor
it’ realli interact the professor can explain us the cours by write on a board and we can speak with himher in real time
becaus it make it easier to organis myself and stay motiv to studi
so i can understand better what im learn eventu stop the video
must say it wa close between live and record live so there is time account ie the lectur start at 3 and there is collabor and abil to ask question to keep engag record allow you to do thing at your own pace which can be nice when deal with these difficult time but equal can becom unmotiv and not watch them
the one class that i have a zoom lectur for is veri scatter and the technolog doesnt seem to be work veri well the prerecord lectur are where i am abl to actual learn thing
easili to ask question
i am email all my content and it upload on googl classroom which mean i can alway come back to it howev sometim the word is confus and the onli attach is the class powerpointresourc we would use in an ordinari lesson not the verbal extra that are often more use i also sometim struggl to keep on top of my work so have the class live would help that
you can look at it when you like and go at your own pace
more like school
becaus i can watch and rewatch at my own pace but i think live class keep me more account and easier for question
you can activ ask more question it is more person
it mean that i’m activ learn instead of watch a premad lectur from befor
i can watch it whenev i want
there are avail whenev i want to use them
haven’t done thi as unfortun it isn’t an option for my sixth form but zoom is good for face to face learn with the teacher
i can ask question while the teacher explain the teacher can understand by our face if we are understand a concept or not
can replay content
it is easi to refer back eg to review someth the teacher said
more interact
allow me to engag with the content and other student
it allow me to have more time for my own type of learn instead of wast it with a professor that doesnt focu on that
you can stop rewind anyth if need
i have to work so live class would not be practic
im abl to particip more and see the other student in my year that way im at least a bit social and im abl to learn better
involv engag and can ask for help
the zoom meet most resembl school but without the most import part interact with other student and even the teacher so honestli it often feel like a wast of time sometim
becaus i can schedul my work time the way i want
better understand
i miss the social environ school provid and with live class i feel closer to that
it is more like a norma class doesn’t feel so quarantin
i think it’ the most engag and an easier way to teach onlin
it let you interact with the professor and other student ask question and answer other student question
the concept can be explain to me fulli and i’m told exactli what i need to do
less pressur
i can work through the lectur at my own pace
it mimic be in school and make me feel like what i’m learn is import and so i don’t lazi around
is the most similar thing to “real” school
well explain and can be done at ani time
less easi to get distract
more contact you feel less distanc
abl to engag with the lectur so it feel closer to “normal” pre covid lectur have a modul deliv in a varieti of way i’v enjoy thi the most i also like that we’r all in zoom togeth and that it give a structur to an otherwis unstructur day
it most like that i will attend if it would be record i would just procrastin with it
i’m in control of when i do my work
i learn better oral it actual goe in my brain haha
i like the interact element as i feel that where i can best develop my idea
becaus all those assign i get just feel like homework the live class feel more like school and i have no excus to procrastin
realtim more structur to my day
i struggl to focu with live lectur
opportun to hold discuss and ask question
so i can take my time to digest the content taught especi becaus some professor seem to go quicker than usual when they can no longer gaug students’ respons
feel the most like an in person lectur
easier to view at amor conveni time rather than what would have been the design lectur time in real time
becaus it hard to stay focus on lectur and especi if it just lectur onlin without almost ani discuss
it’ like a real lesson but you can’t arch anytim and don’t have to feel nervou to be on video chat
most similar to a real classroom allow discuss
it’ immedi you can ask your teacher for help straightaway rather than wait for a repli on email
interact with other help me understand content from multipl perspect and feel involv
becaus it‘ nice to see everyon at least virtual and it feel at least a tini bit like normal class it‘ also a more interact learn experi read through materi your teacher send to you or listen to record lectur is not as engag and interact
it is easier to get clarif
it give a lot more interact with classmat and the teacher
becaus there are no awkward video chat and you can do the work at your own pace with materi rather than have to make note from speak which i haven’t been do much of yet due to be a year 11 and not alevel or uni student and i am therefor not use to it
ask and answer question on the spot live commun
it’ more like real school you can ask the teacher question
content is explain better compar to just read off a written resourc like a powerpoint
i can get on with work at my own pace
go at your own pace complet when you want
you still get the interact with peopl
you can ask question while the lectur is on screen
it’ more engag than be ask to fill out a googl doc with ‘notes’
the professor can provid compact inform and still explain everyth in detail howev i know that thi doesn’t realli enhanc activ learn
it is more up to date than previous record lectur and give us the opportun to ask question
it take less time to go over the same amount of work
it mean that anyon can watch them at ani time help peopl who are in differ time zone and help those who are still work
can go at my own speed
it mean there’ still some form of interact between student and teacher which make it easier to stay concentr and motiv to do the work
becaus i can listen to the teacher and also it the onli mod of teach i am do
there’ more room for connect and qa session than record lectur
i can do it when it’ conveni for me and relisten when i need it
time for actual engag
i learn faster that way
adjust to differ schedul
becaus it similar as be in class it more engag
more intim and keep a connect between teacher and pupil easier to ask for help
it make it way easier to interact with our professor and it’ the closest we can get to an actual lectur it also put a bit more structur in the day as you have a set time frame in which zoom meet or onlin class are be held
becaus i can work through it at my own pace and not feel rush
you can do it in your own time as they’r record you can paus and rewind so that you don’t miss anyth
i can stop and start if i miss anyth
more time to look through the inform more system
it’ easier to ask if i have a problem
as you have direct commun with teacher
can work at my own pace
lectur
more interact
you can engag with your teacher and get immedi feedback if there is someth you don’t understand it’ the most similar to my normal educ befor covid and also allow me to engag somewhat with my friend
i like to relisten thing especi math
interest skill lab
it’ the most interact best for realtim question it’ more human
i can work at my own pace
can work at own pace
easier to understand and not a rush to keep up can paus video and go at your own pace also seem to be more detail than a zoom meet
more interact and allow you to ask question
i am partial a visual learner and have a teacher explain the work to me is more use than me just read the same inform from a textbook
i feel as though thi most close replic an actual seminar and is what motiv me the most
i can watch the at my own schedul and pace howev i like them to be support by live onlin zoom tutori so we can ask question and get feedback
i can do it at my own pace without ani pressur
it is the best possibl substitut for facetofac educ at the moment
self pace and free from interfer of my classmat who end up mess with the teacer usual
i can work through the materi at my own pace
i can ask question and it’ more engag
i can ask question right there and then it also kind of forc some self of disciplin in me have to wake up earli everyday all for these onlin class so in some what of a way it help mimic ur typic school kinda life
it give me time to work at my own pace and hear a real person explain the inform
it not that differ from a regular class
live class are bot access to each and everu student due to network relat barrier in remot area also we can hear the record lectur at ani time as per our suitabl lastli a proper and compar less chaotic chat discuss regard doubt and suggest can also take place and all thi requir much lesser data speed and access in comparison to live stream
feel more normal
sinc the teacher go too fast onlin becaus you have some delay so question get either late or you forget about your question i prefer to watch the video at my own speed
discuss of content
becaus thing get explain better in a video than just by email but i can do it whenev i want and it more flexibl than live lesson
becaus it motiv me to pay attent and it nice to know that everyon is watch at the same time
i need thing to be explain by a teacher as i can’t understand as easili just from read i need to hear thing explain
it mean i can get through the work at my prefer pace and at a time which suit me
it’ less pressur
can take note and paus at ani time to take in the inform
becaus i can learn at my own pace and there’ no “embarrassment” around talk in a group call i find it more intimid than in a classroom environ
becaus i can spent as long as i need on it without feel the pressur i would if it wa live and i can go back and look at it whenev i want
interact with your class and see peopl
becaus i can talk to the lectur and join discuss with my class and it feel as close to an actual seminar as possibl
some lectur do struggl with give good present be abl to work through slidestopicsetc at your own speed help a lot
it feel like we’r in class we can ask question also sinc it’ live you’r forc to do it at that time which help for stay on top of stuff
i would be abl to paus as i needgo back over thing it’ a far clearer way of seat out inform and similar to a regular class without the commit that zoom class have which can sometim caus problem
more interact
i like be abl to do it in your own time and pauserewind to ensur no content is miss
becaus bad internet connect make live classesdiscuss forum imposs
more relev content from the class get cover dure lectur
i can ask question and interact with my teacher and classmat thi not onli help to learn better but also benefit mental health
it the most similar to a normal school environ where my lesson can be explain fulli and i can ask question if need
less scope for technic difficulti allow me to work at my own pace
easier to access can be done in own time fewer issu and is someth tangibl to submit
i think it allow for more particip and you can ask for more help from both your peer and the lectur if you don’t understand someth
most person i learn the most when i can discuss new materi in class my cours translat is also rather practic so it is nice to discuss assign in class
it provid structur to the week it make learn vari eg listen and watch a video as suppos to just read content it’ nice to have some live contact for lectur and ask question in ‘real time’
allow me to plan ahead what i need to complet dure the week allow me to fit the work in whilst give me space to improv my lifestyl by be less stress and pressur by deadlin independ in learn is import to me it help to be abl to alloc suffici time to the work that need it to fulli understand especi physic biolog and math rather than scrambl to write down note in class without have enough time to fulli absorb and grasp the concept the ‘school day’ is less exhaust so i get more work done
i can watch and learn at my own pace
possibl of interact
more engag
you can ask question directli to the teacher
allow better engag of the materi rather than just read resourc from booksarticleswebsit
veri interact abl to ask teacher question and discuss answer with other student

you are in direct contact with the teacher and it feel the most like actual school
i can repeat and go over bit i don’t quit understand at my own pace and consolid part by the repetit of rewatch experi explan exampl etc
our professor tri to make it as interact as possibl and we can just ask question as if in we were in lectur

allow for more engag with the materi and is just more social fulfil
make me actual do it and it nice to see other peopl
you can ask question in live time
you can get it done whenev you want rather than a live class where you have to be there at a certain time
more activ learn like if it wa in person forc you to attend instead of have to self motiv to watch the lectur stream
no facial contact
more interact and give more opportun for student to speak and share their opinion especi import in subject like english literatur

becaus you can paus or rewind the video and watch it when you want to
be abl to learn and ask question in real time
more interact with teacher easier to understand materi and also provid the closest similar to in school learn
couldnt answer more than one but record lectur and live class are equal for me at the moment and i think it make for perfect balanc lectur are nice record to do at my own pace but it is nice to also have interact class to talk about the cours materi
it’ the simplest
you can complet it on your own time
it’ more engag and interest
commun is easier all the inform is easi to find afterward when it written down
becaus it make thing easier to understand as it is like you are in a classroom i think it also help mental health too as it ha a classroom vibe
i find it the best and most effici way of absorb inform without the pressur of a live class
in my opinion and experi i do prefer zoom meet becaus it motiv me to be present and it let my brain know that “oh we’r work now” i also prefer thi method becaus there are other peopl around who are studi with you and it’ nice to have some human connect but i also do like the email work through googl classroom becaus it give me freedom to do research on the topic on my own to suffic my understand while in a classroom i wouldn’t be abl to do that becaus we would be transit from activ to anoth activ and then i would get home to do more homework from all my 7 class and it wouldn’t leav room for me to do some research to further my understand of the topic
it the easiest way
you can watch thema again
i like to be left alon to get on with my work in my own time
live interact and be abl to ask question on the spot
you can comun with a teacher directli
i like be abl to paus the video when i take note so that i can focu my attent on activ listen instead of worri about what i’m miss when i write someth down i also like to revisit the video to rewatch the lectur on more challeng concept especi befor the exam
i can paus the video and rewatch it if i dont understand it i can watch it whenev i want to
less reliant on wifi and less interact as i find it awkward to be interact over thing like zoom
it depend on the cours some are teach better through zoom but for other like statist record lectur work better
i get to see my friend and we can have quick discuss
easiest mode
some professor upload there class on set day in the week other tend to upload them whenev it pleas them that mean one some day we get a week load of work upload and then sometim no one is upload anyth howev sinc the class are avail the whole semest i am not bound to the professor schedul and i can chose when i want to work on a certain subject also look forward to exam season i guess it will be come in handi to be abl to review some lectur
it allow for more person organis on the part of the student which is necessari to accomod the live mental health ressourc specif to each student
easi to interact with the teacher and feel most normal
easier to understand aural learner instant verbal feedback etc
it allow me to do work at my own pace
becaus you can engag with the lesson
keep me on a schedul engag with the content most of my live zoom lectur are record as well
you can complet the work in your own time so you can spend more time focus on your exercis or sleep in for exampl
zoom
it make take detail note easier as i can take the lectur at my own pace and paus where need it is also easier to fit into a schedul as i am not at the behest of someon else’ routin
it allow me to interact and engag with the content better by discuss with peopl
it’ simpl to understand and my laptop doesn’t run out of batteri super quick
i feel like i interact more with the teacher and it help me stay focu
it is easier to do all of the work and i feel like there is less wast class time
engag spontan with professor and student
becaus it is a good mix between guidanc from our seminar leader and contribut from classmat which make it so much more engag a lot more student feel more confid to contribut compar to zoom so it is far more interest to spark debat
the teacher can actual explain the work in person as sometim it can be difficult to understand when the work is just hand over to you by email it also make sure i would do the work as if it wa a zoom class the teacher would know if you’v attend it but with email there is no way to prove weather you have done the work or not
it’ the easiest way to be connect with the hole class and not onli the teacher
i actual get to listen to the inform given compar to just read it help me process everyth clearer
allow me to work at my own pace
it’ way more interact you can ask question etc
i would be abl to actual interact with the class focu and be present
becaus i can plan my own day at go at my own rhythm
becaus it is the onli way to keep human interact and activ learn for student
i prefer to be taught by my teacher rather than teach myself and it give me the opportun to ask question and get an immedi respons
it an easi twoway commun method and feedback is instantli avail
can repeat part of the lectur if need
ha some interact
can do at whatev time
it give the abil to easi interact and ask question and is help with stay motiv
so i can do the work in my own time and live connect aren’t alway the best
more straight forward and activ
it’ more relax and you can go at your own pace
it’ almost as good as real teach you can ask all question etc as the class is happen rather than tri to get hold of someon to ask after
more engag interact and help
more control
live class allow me to keep a schedul and not feel overwhelmedprocrastin if their wa no onlin class i definit did not fulli engag with the materi
interact
more structur content
i find it easier to get done and i don’t experi the fatigu i do after call so i can get more done call and use though
it feel more like a normal lesson and we can talk through concept with our teacher
it will be more interact
i have onli experienc onlin learn via zoom so thi is the onli mode i know
when have a live classroom it is like have actual class where student can particip ask question and give there opinion howev the record lectur do not provid student with the abov and besid it is easi to procrastin when have recod lectur than be oblig to particip on a live class
i studi english and histori so i realli valu real time discuss which get me think in way i otherwis would never sadli thi is not the main form of class
live class feel like the onli way to engag with my professor and classmat and upload materi feel like veri passiv learn it also feel like asynchron class significantli reduc the qualiti of my educ and it is an extrem disappoint
give you the chanc to ask question
becaus i can watch them when i want so that i can organ my time better
it discussionbas
it most close resembl actual lesson
easier to understand what is be taught
thi provid flexibl to studi if other thing have to be done it also allow the chanc to go over content if i need to spend more time learn a concept
it’ good to be abl to see and hear professor student live it give a sens of normal and keep me somewhat engag and motiv
becaus it is the onli one which can best simul a classroom environ
it easi to go at your own pace whilst work to ensur that you suffici understand the materi
can be repeat
zoom
i realli like that i can speed it up or slow it down even throughout differ part of a singl lesson to fit my need
i can bounc idea off of other in the classroom and ask question instantli
you can go back over materi in your own time and repeat area that are harder to understand
you can commun with your teacher instantli
i can choos when to paus the video and take a break that option is not possibl when the class is on zoom or the like onlin teach lack the social aspect of catch commun sign in eye and bodi languag which in turn tire out the brain faster if the lectur were prerecord with upload materi the student could choos to join studi group and discuss the materi afterward at their own pace
it minimis the massiv disrupt by continu to provid some structur to the learn but it still not great
i prefer learn the materi on my own and at my own pace
as you can ask question and it’ the closest thing to be in a classroom environ
it allow for direct interact with the teacher and classmat
if it work it interact and forc you to think and do thing as oppos to just watch lectur like theyr netflix
i prefer to be abl to stop the record and go over part i havent understood fulli which i cant do with my onlin seminar in live class
it motiv me more to attend and do the work also it’ nice to actual have someon speak it’ not all up to me
access anytim which is not possibl with live class most of my materi includ record lectur or video on topic and sometim honestli someon on the internet teach a concept better than your professor could do
i prefer to be selfdirect as thi is the most flexibl option and i enjoy be abl to get my school work done earli everi week
as i can paus and rewind section to fulli understand concept i struggl with so i have more control also video and audio is more grip for me than just email articl etc
easier to learn and keep me focus
other method don’t suit my learn style and prevent me from be abl to understand and complet the work to my full capabl in addit some other method caus me stress and anxieti which disrupt my learn eg live class
keep me account and help structur my day otherwis i would do less work
it’ easier to look back at and to take note in whatev structur i want to i’m also abl to get my teacher view point on the topic we are cover and appli my own opinion to it also
more opportun for engag
more interact feel more like the contact we had prior to lockdown
becaus it allow you to work at your own pace and you can have a discuss with your peer about it afterward without ani pressur from specif meet
im on a translat section of my degre so major od our work anyway is submit translat and other essayspap done at home it seem most similar to what we would do if not fot the covid i also dont like uni video call as a person prefer and becaus i feel im much more tire afterward than after normal class
becaus i can paus and rewatch bit i don’t understand
interact
alongsid record materi for help with it like be abl to get in w it by muself
im abl to creat my own studi schedul and access record class ani time i want
it like normal class and we get to see our class and have discuss
i have experienc both in the last few month depend on the cours i’m take i find i am more attent in zoom lectur and although they do not allow for faster playback speed i find that sinc it occur at a preset time i do not find myself put the work off till a later date
engag and interact with peer and direct commun with teacher to clarifi queri
live class can be veri stress becaus of connect problem
i can paus the video whenev to write note
it best resembl the actual class experi
you can rewind if you don t get it right away
it is becaus it is interact
becaus i can work alon and organ my time better
suppli a more strict schedul to the week
closest to normal class
you can ask live question in person by talk and you still somehow have a human connect voic webcam
it is as close as you can get to be in person without be in person there is more opportun for discuss or to ask question etc
you can paus and scroll back if you miss a point and you can listen to it ani time you want
more interact seem more jormal
becaus i can stop the lectur and take note
allow a littl more freedom in how i learn
becaus the insight of one student could contribut to the learn of other and becaus it help to develop critic think
can go at your own pace
you can ask ani question if need and talk with other
it easi to follow you can watch the video multipl time if you dont understand someth
becaus when they upload a video i constantli delay to watch it
becaus i can plan thi in on my own moment and in our case it were lectur from previou year so basic the question that i have are ask in the lectur so the instructor doe go over them also i can paus and replay a part that i dont understand at the first time
becaus you have to do it at a certain time feel more normal and creat a routin when watch lectur back it’ easi to paus and get distract but if it’ live you have to focu
at least for me i’m a senior in the usa and basic i wa at the end of my high school educ im in all ap and most of materi for my them were cover befor covid so it wa nice to be abl to do my review assign on my own schedul also it wa nice sinc now that my whole famili is at home i am abl to help out with home respons and don’t have the stress of have to make it to a zoom call at a certain time
becaus if i didnt understand someth i can alway return back the lectur
interact learn
it the most interact and classroom like
your abl to ask question and you still have some interact with your classmat
i like watch the lectur at my leisur and be abl to paus them but major of our teach is tutori system so obvious thi is whi it mostli live class of ca 3 student
becaus i can rewatch the lectur whenev i need it
becaus the tea her would be abl to see bodi languag and express to explain the task well so it make it clearer for me
replic natur of classroom work environ as best as possibl
give an opportun to ask question straight away when they aris instead of have to email later
becaus you can studi whenev you want also you can stop the video to take note
becaus it make you oblig to follow a schedul and therefor creat a sens of structur in these day that all feel the same
becaus my cours are gener taught through discuss so without that it’ hard to gaug what is actual necessari long record are hard to stay engag with
i understand materi better when someon explain it to me in their own word rather than a textbook definit
can watchrewatch at anytim
to ask question and find out other people’ opinion also feel more sociabl and less formal
it is flexibl for student and allow for more explan
actual see your professor and classmat give you a feel of connect you simpli don’t get from just text i feel like see my teacher and talk to fellow student is crucial to succeed in my studi and to not feel so alon
it the closest to a physic classroom
it’ more interact and allow better teacherstud commun
i feel awkward on video chat and i can do the upload materi in my own time and when it suit me much better for my schedul than school as i am a young carer
the teacher are abl to go into more detail than if it wa just written on a powerpoint and the fact that they’r talk to you still it give you the feel somewhat that you’r still in class these are also a plu as you can dictat your own timet don’t have to show up to specif meetingscal at a specif time everi day
it is more person and you get to ask your teacher more easili
it’ a way the teacher can teach and explain thing as if we were in the classroom but you also have the option to rewind if you don’t understand anyth and work at your own pace
becaus the professor is explain it but i can access it at ani time
we were normal given work at the start of the day so i knew exactli what my task wa for that class and wa more motiv to get it down in the class time i found with onlin meet onc the call end i got distract veri easili and went on my phone or check what work i had for other class instead of start the work i had just been given howev i did realli like onlin meet as it wa the easiest way for thing to be explain or to ask question
becaus i can break down the lectur into smaller part make it easier for me to stay concentr and also to think about everyth be said
more person round up the lectur
i like to be abl to interact is also make thing seem a littl bit more normal
clear answer given and can complet at a time conveni for you
becaus you can actual see peopl and interact with them in a person and direct way furthermor it is easier to learn when a teacher explain a topic than learn on your own
quickest way of get help when confus and forc me to focu
feedback is avail and you can see other students’ respons good for engag and feel part of thing again less anxieti induc than zoom which caus an artifici social atmospher that is difficult to get around and it’ easi to feel more ‚put on the spot‘ also can be done at ani time which is use sinc it is larg imposs to keep to ani kind of tight regul schedul like it is when actual studi in uni
record lecturesvideo
question can be answer directli
becaus you don’t get the same level of inform from just read the materi that is sent out the reason lectur are held the way they are is becaus you gain addit all inform from the lectur dure the lectur
i haven’t had ani record video howev i think i would prefer thi way becaus with just my class work be upload there is no one explain it
the most interact option
at least even if were far from each other i can interact more with my classmat and my professor
becaus it’ easier to work through at my own time and pace rather than a call i need to be activ on at a certain time
my univers focu is on asynchron learn i can access them at ani time and i can work through the content at my own pace i can skip through content i alreadi knowspe it up i then have more time to engag with the content such as tutori i also get to go back to the lectur videosslid and use them as my note
im more focu dure live class
more interact and discuss
becaus you can talk through question and get other people’ view on topic
i can watch and learn at my own pace
it’ simpl and clear
it keep me on a similar schedul to school and is more help than leav me to creat my own routin and fall behind
googl meet with share screen for visual aid
it’ easier for me as someon with a learn difficulti to be abl to paus and rewind lectur and is less stress that zoom classesdiscuss board
it keep me on a similar schedul to school and is more help than leav me to creat my own routin and fall behind
becaus i can watch them back or paus if i need to
it’ good to hear our teacher and their insight in the cours work
unfortun thi ha been the onli option avail
more interact
becaus it hard for me to particip in discuss in school or onlin so i prefer learn on my own and plan out my schedul myself
you can listen as mani time as you need to
it make it easier for me to revis the inform better and i can just email my teacher if i have ani question which i prefer to live session
it allow more interact teacherstud it less intimid and we can ask without send email and bureaucrat stuff it more direct and it feel more normal see other human face ha becom someth realli import at thi time
i can watch it when i feel like im more in the zone so i can learn better
it allow me to plan my own break and schedul my day in the way i would like it to be
visualauditori learner abl to take my time
i can ask question in real time
more interact usual smaller group and feel much more inform and engag
so depend on which class but live forc you to do someth as oppos to make your own schedul but both are prefer
it’ easier to follow a live class as it is more interact
can learn at my own pace do it when i want
can ask question which are answer instantli and hear input from other
easier for me as a hear impair student if we were to do it onlin it might be difficult for me to understand my teacher and lip read
you can still ask question and i eye tact with the class
it keep me account and it function a lot more like my class did befor
it allow for more interact with the teacher and classmat dure the lectur i can ask my question straight away when i think of them instead of stockpil them to ask in an email after class i also feel like it easier to reach the answer you want even if you mayb phrase the question weirdli or cant realli articul what it is you dont understand becaus it a realtim backandforth with the lectur and they can also use visual aid in a differ way to visualis concept that might be more difficult to explain properli in just text or with still pictur if it someth that move in a particular way
i can stop skip and do whatev i want with the lectur
posit human interact that provid balanc to an otherwis lock down day
thi way it give me more independ on the structur of my day and requir me to learn to work on my own and if i don’t understand someth i can take more time howev i believ a mix of both confer and upload thing is ideal
i can concentr better when i am activ particip and involv
becaus i can watch the lectur whenev i want and dont have to interact immedi
record lectur
it give an illus of normal class and a chanc to ask question live so we have a better understand of the topic
the most simpl way to listen to the lesson and be abl to ask question andor for help and get an immedi respons from the teacher
becaus there is an opportun to ask question face to face plu we can have 1 to 1s as well
forc me to engag in the content
it is the closest thing to the in person teach were all accustom to and it make it easier for student to engag with teacher and ask question and readili get the help they may need
easi to follow
encourag me to be present and engag more with the content

i prefer activ and interact learn instead of just watch video
it is interact
easi to ask a question then and there
i can take my time and stop the video whenev i need to and also if i do not feel confid about a certain topic i can simpli rewatch the lesson
becaus i can rewatch it everi time i need to

it is the most similar to in school learn
becaus it’ similar to normal class
i like the problem base learn pbl approach of my univers that is veri focus on engag student in discuss i think tutori in small group make you more proactiv toward your learn process we now have recod lectur which i like more than “realinperson” one as i can paus them and adjust the speed nevertheless they are more just a extens of the read for the tutori
it’ just like be in a classroom but at home it’ easier to ask question and have discuss whilst learn the content
onlinerecord lectur can be veri dri upload or email content allow you to take your own time and digest the materi at your own speed it’ also easier to do extra read and research along with the work
i can paus it and watch it again and again until i understand it
becaus i’m abl to refer back to the record lectur when i need more clarif

it is interact it enabl class discuss and contact with the teacher
there is more interact with class member which lead to greater insight and understand of the cours materi

i like to take in the inform at my own pace i believ thi enabl me to dive deeper into a subject
i think it the best way to learn someth and discuss thing you may have problem with becaus talk through email isnt as good and it take much more time to explain someth
enabl you to get the same level of detail teach full rich as if you attend but you can paus and replay at leisur good for write up onli draw back is a lectur now take me 2 hour rather than 1 😂
interact
i can paus it and make detail note
becaus you have direct contact with the teacher you can ask question and talk to the teacher on the spot
i’m a organis person so i can plan out my day and do it at my pace but i understand it’ not for everyon
easier to collabor with other student and share idea respons are quicker when ask question
look cool
attend synchron class is difficult at home would rather listen to lectur on my own time
becaus the instructor that just give us materi do not seem to care much and leav us to struggl our way through
record class are easier to follow along and enabl better time manag with other task that came up due to covid 19
you dont have to wait for long to get a repli and it as similar to normal class as possibl
i find it easier when my teacher can explain concept to me
it allow for teacher to explain easili and quickli and it’ easier to ask question

can do the work at a time suitabl for me can take break when i feel they are need
honestli class in person i dont like at all onlin learn and it not becaus i cant learn is beacus i am spend my parent life time save in an educ that is suppos to be in person if i want to learn onlin i would just watch yt video which are way better than my professors’ video
i can visual see what the teacher want me to do and i can go over it whenev i wantne and i feel i learn and understand a topic better
the video are concis and come with link activ i can do the prerecord video at my own pace and time
it provid a room for activ learn and ask question

easier to focu than read but access at all time can paus it
it is interact and offer a similar environ to seminar enabl greater discuss and understand
it allow for more engag between the instructor and student
it still give structur and doesn’t leav you strand to do all the work on your own
there’ more engag within the lesson
becaus it help to not loos the contact even if it via a screen with the teacher and the classmat and also you keep a schedul and and a rutin
so that it is easier to both understand the materi and reach the teacher about part where i don’t understand the concept email usual take a lot longer 23 day
as then there can be no interfer in the teach process and thing can be explain to you as if you were there
you can ask question easier and feel more comfort as you’r not be seen by other peopl
becaus interact is possibl and it‘ closer to a ‚real‘ class than other mode
give me the freedom to learn it how i’d understand it straight away not a sociabl person so i think zoom would be a big struggl
it feel the most ‘normal’ in depth discuss can occur without the restrict of messageforum base learn
allow more activ engag the abil to ask and answer question simul a classroom set
we haven’t had much virtual teach as we aren’t a prioriti year group year 11 but for start my a level cours i would love a video or zoom call
time to take note comprehens info that’ not just fill in sheet also i don’t need to look present like i would for a zoom call haha
less stress in the sens of not have to call anyon howev it can be a bit discourag becaus of the lack of contact
allow student to replic the class room environ with teacher to maximis learn time
be abl to rewind and rewatch
i feel more motiv to studi just have pre record lectur feel pointless
it is convieni for me becaus i can do the materi ani time i want
the abil to ask question and listen to discuss live is much more engag and encourag i can grasp concept better if someon explain them rather than from onli a written resourc
it allow for some interact between lectur and student though it is consider less than in real life
it allow me to watch a class and ask question live to the teacher like i would if i were at univers and then they suppli us the zoom record if we want to see it again
ask can ask question dure the lectur and receiv answer where as if pre record have to email and is a longer process
i find seminar group more benefici that lectur
you can ask qs see other in your class
less wast time

i can look through them in my own time at my own pace conveni
becaus i can paus and take note
i like work at my own pace and choos my own time and structur
let’ you work at your own pace
more interact need for opportun to ask specif question and clarifi respons to these question

allow for forc engag and ‘there and then’ help from lectur
teacher are there to answer ani question while theyr fresh
i don’t need to be stress about it be live
can do it at whatev time
no other help ha been offer
not onli abl to learn the inform but also ask question about the specif thing we are learn
you can give the teacher more feedback and ask question which can help you to understand the content better
i love the idea that i can do everyth in my own preffer time i am more of a night owl so be abl to do the work in the even make me a lot more product
i can do it in my tempo

interact and give instant answer to problem
doesnt put ani pressur in term of attend and time
i like be abl to do thing when i feel like and be abl to actual work through thing help me understand them
the materi is more understand when given in an interact style even if it is not a direct discuss and also you can take your time and understand everyth in more depth without have thing alreadi plan
i can manag my product time on my own without depend on the set time of an onlin lectur
i like to be abl to paus and right down comprehens note and also expand the lectur note with my own idea and thought i feel like i can get more out of lectur thi way
i can look back
make it easier to studi at your pace and accord to your availabilit
you get to talk to your teacher
interact and can ask question
it enabl peopl to talk more openli in convers then on video which can be stilt
i can work at my own pace
easier to follow not awkward
discuss chat are rubbish asynchron class are even wors live class are sometim amaz becaus you get to interact with the teacher and other student sometim theyr also a wast of time
it’ hard for me to actual sit through prerecord lecturesread through upload slide document on my own
can watch at my own pace and read note along side make it easier to grasp a topic can watch when i want as well which is more conveni
easier for teacher to explain actual teach the lesson
i find zoom lesson stress and too fast as well as be difficult to work around my job
replay content help better my understand of the subject
as i can understand how the professor ha explain the content and be abl to review the lectur more than onc
have actual face time with my professor and classmat ha realli help me feel motiv thi semest even though i am at home do zoom class gave me some remind that i wa in colleg and requir to complet collegelevel work the breakout group on zoom were also help for peer collabor though it is nowher near the same as in person class
i don’t usual contribut much in class i prefer to listen to other and make my own note and discuss forum forc me to contribut or i’m record as have not attend the class
it a more activ approach to learn promot engag and particip plu you can see your coursem and lectur
i got out of habit of take note fast dure a lectur where i have to listen to prof i just cant keep up anymor so it nice to write them note down at my own pace while listen to music
i can paus and rewatch thing i didn’t quit get
it is less easi to get distract in live meet
becaus it feel more like i am in an actual lesson
it’ much easier to commun with teacher in real time and ask question about the materi rather than email about it later on and wait for a repli
face to face learn is the way i learn best when you can ask question and get immedi detail answer
i can watch the lectur whenev
it stop me from procrastin to watch the record one
abil to work around my own routin and pauserewind if i need to easi to manag and access if i need addit help i can alway messag my teacher
more engag
i can interact with the teacher more so and ask question if i do not understand someth where as with email one ha to wait quit a long time to have a repli back from the teacher
it is far more engag and stimul than sit at my desk do prescrib work expes dure thi allreadi isol time it is much more help to be abl to have a discuss on a topic and take note dure a live class as it is much closer to the real deal of learn in school
you can get live feedback from your teacher and your lesson can proceed a bit like usual
provid a better understand of a topic when verbal describ
i work at my own pace
i like how you can paus and rewind the video when you dont understand someth or if my mind ha start wander so you can play it back again
easi to ask question while get taught about the subject
i would find talk awkward
more like school
easier to manag my time
i find it easier to understand the content when someon explain and talk through it in detail so although we haven’t been sent ani record lectur i feel as though it would be easier to learn thi way
i think that i end up learn more thi way
i enjoy be abl to discuss the subject matter with my professor and other student rather than work independ
becaus interact is possibl
face to face contact with a teacher and provid more of a structur lesson
becaus that way i van replay bit that i find difficult
honestli i like record lectur too it compact and organ the content nice but on live class we can ask question to teach immedi and share idea in chat room and i dont have to be feel like alon
live class replac actual lectur the best
it feel a littl bit more realist and i can ask doubt easier
more opportun for discuss and eas of ask question
you can do the work when you would like too rather at the time of the lesson it give you a more flexibl routin
keep me account to do my workcom to class
becaus it’ the closest we get to normal school and that way we get to interact with our classmat like if we were took physic class
becaus it allow me to go outsid of school hour to work on it i am most product at night
easier for my schedul as i work full time
get to actual ask question and get support you need or ani clarif of the lectur materi
it more engag and forc one to block time in the schedul
compar to if they did the lectur live i can do the lectur when it suit me rather than at a set time it mean i can also get ahead as well becaus all the lectur were upload at onc
i dont feel comfort be at home and sit in a virtual classroom at the same time and i dont like the platform we use zoom
live class are much more engag with the record lectur the lectur speak so quickli that it is hard to grasp the concept
the materi is concis and i can understand exactli what i need to be learn to keep up i am too easili distract in a lengthi video call
more access for me becaus my laptop’ camera doesn’t work and i can’t afford anyth new at the moment
it better keep everybodi account
i am shi and have an anxieti disord so live class are difficult for me sinc i feel expos
you can ask ani question there and then and it is more interact
there is opportun to relearn the content of not understood properli by look at record lectur
it is the onli one that ha been offer to me
easier to do in your own time
human interact teacher can explain right away if i don’t understand someth
i find it easier in thi time to work at my own pace and i am more of a visual learner
direct interact with prof and colleagu
more interact with teacher
it hold me account and it the most practic for ask question
my teacher done offer thi howev i feel it would be help for english as i’m lack class discuss
it’ similar to how i work at colleg
you have your teacher and your mate to talk with and discuss today’ lesson also help with the social aspect
no pressur but good materi
it imit an in person class as well as it can it also mark the begin and end of a class as well as you’r abl to ask question dure the lesson
it os the closest mode to oneon class like we use to have
i like how it is similar to our normal teach style when were at uni
you can paus the video at ani time and work at your own pace
more flexibl prefer upload materi in addit to occasion onlin courseslectur good mix of interact but be flexibl enough in plan the workload throughout the week
becaus the educ can discuss issu real time
abl to fulli understand the lesson at your own pace
allow me to paus and go back when need
abl to ask teacher question live allow you to have discuss and convers see your teacher face and they can present a powerpoint which is what happen in most of our normal class at school so it’ as close to normal as possibl
there is interact with the lectur
feel more person easier to interact and ask question along the way
becaus i actual get taught stuff instead of just use my own brain especi with stuff like english i need to hear the teacher interpret of the piec
more reliabl than zoom call bad connect etc also allow learn at my own pace
they are usual narrat powerpoint or screencast good as i can paus and understand and take note it’ like do it on a whiteboard but i have time to go back and listen again which is so use
it is the most interact form
it make you abl to discuss the content learn or the homework you’v done
it is nicer to work with a video than just written note also the fact that it’ prerecord allow us to go back and listen again to point we did not get
give you a chanc to ask question in real time teacher can properli explain the inform instead of reli on you to teach yourself
more effici

the teacher is abl to combin differ method
becaus i can go back if i miss someth and it’ easier to take note
you can interact with your tutor in real time rather than have to wait for respons and compar to a live call you are abl to complet task at your own pace and time yet still be motiv to do them becaus of the onlin chat
person but can be done when it suit you
i can watch them in my own time instead of dure schedul timet and there is less risk of have connect issu like there might be dure a live lectur
i can go at my own speed and don’t have the fear of be ask a question i don’t know
your not pressur on time when it may be hard to get on with stuff in a home environ
becaus i can discuss idea and concept with teacher and classmat there and then upload materi alon isnt veri motiv and it difficult to contact the teacher outsid of the lesson slot if you have question it much more engag to have a real discuss
it allow me to fit uni work in when i feel physic and mental capabl as there have been day where my mental health ha been bad not be abl to attend zoomonlin lectur make me feel wors
we can complet the work mostli at our own pace and still do further research commun with teacher doesn’t feel unnecessari or prolong
in theori you are abl to ask question directli to the teacher so it would be like your were in a regular class
i can replay whenev and can keep for revis later
more interact et ne with quarantain it is nice to see familiar face other than famili
more interact i learn better by auditori learn but live class make me feel uncomfort and i’m not as focus on the materi i also like be abl to do uni work at ani time’ as i also have a job
most time consum but made me feel somewhat normal rather than just email my independ work to professor which i did for some of my class
interact closest to real life class
it is the onli method that my school ha been give out materi through and is work quit benefici for me
learn by listen is easier for me than other way
do at my own pace and take time over read
it the closest we have to normal
becaus it a direct interract we can ask question and we can memoris more easili but just two of my professor choos thi mode
becaus i can manag my time but at the same time i get the explan from the teacher howev i like the live class opportun to interact but right now with everyth that is go on id rather watch the lectur whenev i feel motiv and i feel like im go to make the most of it
it is the closer to normal class and the other are more like studi new subject on your own than actual be taught the subject
i can watch at my own pace
easier to commun while see each other
it feel similar to a live lectur so you get all the explan you might need whilst be abl to paus and rewind to make note more easili you can go over someth as mani time as you like
basic we have class on microsoft team but they are record in the same time i have realis it is easier and more effect for me to listen to them recored later on and make paus search thing onlin and such
easier to stay concentr and motiv easier to ask question
you can watch them in your own time and schedul your own day
feel engag and provid structur
can go at my own pace at a conveni time
you can easili ask question if someth is unclear and it the closest thing to actual class
becaus it is the onli mode of teach so i cannot compar it to other mode
it more engag and make you an activ part of the class which help retain the taught materi
live class on zoom
easi to get instant respons to question
easi commun
easi and can do in own time
i can go back and review the info
cant be put on spot and i am actual abil to work through the materi at your own pace
i thrive on discuss
you can do the work when you want to
i can watch it again when i forgot someth
more motiv and actual help when you need answer straight away instead of them ignor our email for week on end
i learn more by be surround with other peopl
these offer an option to paus and rewind so that learn can be conduct at my own pace
more interact with the materi be present easier to ask question reason out answer and hear differ opinionsview on a topic other than your own
it’ more interact student can debat in a control manner and the lectur is also present to talk through point and give her outlook
it’ easi and the inform on the materi is usual explain well
individu time manag
it’ more relax and individu
as im in uni of technolog it is easier to follow and learn program from easi to read and look back on materi
most interact and thu help me keep up motiv i also get to see my friend and can quickli get help if need
easi to ask question
you can ask question and get a respons rather than email your teacher
more interact with the professor and other student
can commun directli with lectur
it feel less daunt to be set a task in a set lesson time where the teacher can explain the task more clearli then to be set multipl piec of work to be complet over a longer time period i find it extrem anxieti provok to email messag my teacher when i need help or to ask a question it’ easier to ask the question dure a live class with out the live lesson it’ easier for the work to pile up and becom realli overwhelm
commun is easier that way and i have the opportun to ask question it feel more natur
it’ more interact than email which we also use a lot
more engag with peer and tutor which help consolid learn compar to simpli watch record lectur mindlessli and not activ learn
becausr it forc me to sit down and learn the work without have to teach it to myself or make myself do it instead of wast time
becaus thi way student are much more like to get engag in the lesson and to have a direct discuss
give me the opportun to ask question more easili
becaus i get to organis my time and also i don’t have to worri about the pressur that come with write do thing in the comput and pay attent to the onlin class
give structur to the day easier to encod inform when you don’t have the abil to “pause” liter
if you have a question you can easili ask them that not the case with record class
becaus it’ easier and faster to ask question easier commun less confus
i can engag with the materi at my own pace
it wa the same content we receiv in lectur in person but but by be record allow us the flexibl to decid how to schedul our time
it is just like a normal class but it’ not a live call so it doesn’t make peopl nervou
i think not everyon ha the same schedul dure these uncertain time so i prefer anyth other than live chat sinc you need to stick to a time that may or may not be conveni to everyon in addit you could then studi at your own pace without feel ani addit pressur
lectur are there to talk to and you don’t have to wait for an email
have the flexibl to complet the class whenev you want
time are flexibl thi way
easier to stay focus and motiv dure the class more interact with the professor
live class are realist
i get to engag with other peopl and be held account for my learn
you can paus at ani time you want and also watch it back later
if it wa ani of the other option i probabl wouldn’t do the work
we didn’t have ani live class onli upload record but i think they would be most similar to inperson lectur in that you can ask question in real time instead of have to email lectur
more flexibl timewis i can do my work in the middl of the night if i want to
i want to be abl to directli ask question to tge tutorprofessor
i like be abl to speed up the content when i understand it and slow it down when i don’t
technic problem dure a live session can‘t occur and i get more explain than when i just get a script
interact and provid structur to my day
abl to see written in a board veri similar to tradit lectur
deeper understand with a discuss basi on the work
less stress about get readi or look and present and easi accessx
becaus we are abl to ask question and get thing clarifi or explain again
i can paus it when it go too fast
i can rematch at my own pace and also jot down question as i go it’ easier to manag than have to multitask dure a zoom call although the social interact element of video call is import
it is easier to ask question and have a direct contact with the teacher as well as the rest of the class
it feel the closesr to a normal class with the abil to ask question and have them answer ad the sidetrack banter or convers to checkup on how everyon is do is a key for me in keep motivatedconcentr
question get answer quickli and you can go back and search to see if other peopl had the same question
so i have the time to stop it and take better note
can go at my own pace speed up skip replay work at my own timet
you ger to interact with each other
i learn best when abl to ask question and get feedback real time i also miss human contact so see other peopl is nice
can do at ani time
we are abl to ask question and see demonstr
i prefer it as i am shi in video call and i feel more comfort with email
explain in more detail and can be access anytim
it give the most concret inform the qualiti is the best
i like it better becaus it veri similar to inclass lectur
i get to see my classmat in real time and it feel more like an actual class it also add more account for do work becaus i’m not just share my answer with a professor i’m also engag with classmat
peopl can help each other
i miss face to face contact
it is easier to rais ani concern with the modul particularli in small class modul
easier
easier to learn as it provid proper teach but with no connect issu as it can be laggi on live lesson ani question you have can just be email and it feel more like a proper lesson
i can ask lot of question
we get to have someth that’ sort of close of normal school we can hear each other discuss materi and the teacher can ask question as usual it work well if you’r a smaller amount of peopl
freedom to studi individuali
minim time wast on discuss previou work i can choos the time of my class
becaus my class have a more strict schedul and i can studi more consist with record lectur for exampl i lack the self disciplin i need in order to keep myself on a schedul
more like normal lectur
to me it the one that look the most to real class i use to have befor our univers close physic
it’ more flexibl than live class but emul what normal lectur would be like realli well
becaus we can ask our question and dont have to wait for day to get a respons it also feel more person which is whi i take it more serious
you can paus the lectur so you can take better note all my lectur have been record but with our project we have call with our counsellor om team and in our studi group we use discord when we are not togeth
it is extrem more interact and mimic a real lesson as much as possibl
it feel like be back in school and it is nice to talk to peopl
can rewatch and paus to go at my own pace
then i can do the work at a time that suit me rather than a schedul time by uni which may not work in my daili life now
i have use it for open day and it is much more interact and is closest to a classroom environ
easier to digest by myself
as i am abl to paus and reflect take detail note or messag a friend sametim about the content as if we are in a class togeth
it allow me to structur my day myself where i could access class materi and record class when i wa avail while also deal with issu at home i knew how long a class would be and how much time id need for it as live one often ran over time they also seem to be more tothepoint and less unnecessarili chatti and longwind mani live lectur
we can interact with the teacher
access to teacher can ask question
becaus we can interact with the instructor and ask them question relat to the work that ha been set
find it veri help to paus and rewind what is be side better for notetak
more motiv
i can watch whenev i want
better engag and feel almost the same as be in a classroom
i feel involv in the learn enough that i am motiv to do it if i am just sent the materi i tend to forget to studi or ignor it out of lack of interest i know that sound realli bad but if i’m not physic present in the learn i can’t get my brain to be interest in it
your abl to work through the materi at your own pace take break when you need to and it a lot more effici becaus you arent be carri by your teacher and have to actual engag your brain
allow the lectur to be view in your own tone while also enabl the opportun to rewatchexplor further
it is more interact and it’ easier for the teacher to explain anyth need
the possibl of interact with classmat and professor whilst still have the freedom of work on my own schedul
i feel like i get more out of the time if everyon is prepar to discuss a topic instead of sit and listen and take note fore sever hour in a row
for me thi is the most effect way of learn
it creat more of an in class feel like i’m actual at colleg it also help to understand explan rather than reli on email
the commun feel more natur thi way
easier to engag and feel more involv with my class
interact and allow for question
i just like it better teacher can tell us what he didnt write in the present
it is a more interact way to explain difficult concept and properli address situat as well as a more welcom and open atmospher to ask question also more close mimic a classroom environ
i will actual do it
becaus you can inferact with the teacher plu sinc i cant paus i pay a lot more attent i just wish they were record as sometim internet fail and i miss inform
can speed up the lectur if it not particularli challeng and can go back over content if it more difficult it also let you dk the lectur properli in one sit rather than go through a live lectur half heartedli and have to look over it again after
can replay the video to revis anytim i want
becaus you are abl to ask the teacher right away if you are wonder about someth and they can see the student facial express while teach
becaus then we are actual taught it and can ask question as we go
be live would make it easier to interact with the lectur and ask question compar to lectur that have just been reupload from last year
i feel more engag as i’m physic listen talk to someon
i find it easiest as i can skip and rehear part that are easi hard
more contact and reassur due to facetofac aspect
becaus i can replay thing i didnt understand and can learn whenev i want
paus the lectur while take note studi in your own time
becaus i can do my work ahead of time for the most part but i havent tri anyth els either
it easie becaus i get to do thing on my own time
i get to activ particip in the discuss instead of just attent a cours thu engag with the materi better
i can make my own schedul
even in quarantin it can be hard to keep up with live lectur so have the option to watch them back is veri help
i can self studi and plan my day to my like for exampl math in the morn and art in the afternoon also i prefer self studi over life class befor covid i can be more product and activ when i do self studi
my univers onli offer record lectur main modul lectur had finish prior to covid so just some for my dissert prep have been upload as record lectur
becaus i think it feel closest to actual teach
can paus and play at own speed to understand the content and can go back if you miss someth
you can ask question
forc me to pay attent
it’ nice to be abl to ask question vocal
i feel like becaus i’m do an englishcr write degre use discuss board and peer review for paper and workshop for the past few month wa a lot less anxieti induc than some previou class and inperson workshop were so for that reason i enjoy some of my class a fair bit thi semest
increas interact and enabl quick respons to question throughout a lectureclass
becaus it still maintain a certain degre of relationship between peopl
becaus i am an independ learner and it is a practic field of studi it give me more time to actual do the practic work
i learn better
abl to ask question and gain a better understand than set work with littl follow up
i can set my own timet and work around my own schedul
becaus it allow interact
i think it a good way to “replace” normal class my teacher at least can realli engag us
feel as though i’m watch from the classroom but from my own home
easi to follow
you can easili access help without wait for an email for age it also feel like a normal lesson
easi to access can pauserewind etc at my leisur
allow us to activ interact with the teacher and hesh can ask us question about the content so we rememb it better plu email materi is just plain and bore to work on in gener
talk through answer without fear of speak on a call or not have question answer over email
thi is the onli medium i have experi in
it’ much more similar to regular school and more interact it give student more structur to their day
can access ani time
i can view thi at ani time and i could paus if it go too fast
can watch it whenev i want and repeat part i miss watch it twice
it the closest experi to a classroom environ and i get the most out of my teacher
can work at a time that suit you
it’ most interact
it is the most similar to normal noncovid time class if they were all prerecord video i probabl would never get around to watch them becaus of procrastinationlazinessno motiv
it feel more “real”
it’ easier to learn and to particip
eas of use and no set time restraint
becaus we get more explan
it is simpl and easi to follow i can do it in my own time and the 1 to 1 feedback and support from teacher via email is also veri help
it feel the most “normal” we can see everyon interact with everyon and ask question to the teacher it’ a lot more engag than just watch a record lectur for exampl
i am abl to learn at my own pace without be stress about not be abl to keep up
becaus i can reward it and relisten to the point i did not understand and i can take note easili
im abl to access inform at ani time and at my own conveni
flexibl can paus and doesn’t feel awkward ask question
i can paus it to think about thing and write everyth down in time i don’t have to worri about miss anyth also it mean i can do it at a time that suit me
i struggl with live class as they are just not as effici or engag as face to face so i prefer to do lectur in my own time
becaus i can work at my own pace access the inform necessari for a task and ask for help when need
i can complet the work at my own pace and at a time that is suitabl for me
it is the easiest to follow alon with and you can alway press paus and your note are veri detail
can ask question in the moment
becaus it’ a live interact between teacher and pupil
it feel more like a normal lesson
becaus i learn best through listen and thi way i can ask question and hear other contribut
easi to ask question and it feel a bit like a real life class
feel like real interact and retain a sens of normal through the format
more flexibl time manag it work better
make it easier to do thing on your own time
with the chang rhythm of the day and often feel down ist great to be flexibl when to do the lectur
easi to stop and record the video if you like and can watch in own time
it still give you that bit of social interact and structur throughout the dayweek
live class on microsoft team make me veri anxiou
more interact opportun for personalis learn
it allow me to work at my own pace and then freeli research a topic if i don’t understand it sole from the provid explan the teacher ha email on the powerpoint i find that i absorb inform better thi way and am more product
closest thing relat to the in person seminar
i can studi in my own pace
paus and be abl to take note without stress myself
set time for zoom lectur motiv me to get up and do colleg onlin
are abl to go back to it for consolid whenev and can alway ask classmat or lectur question if not understand it
you can ask question and interact with other
you can do it in your own time but you stiff have guidanc from the teacher
becaus i can do it when i have the time to do it or want to do it i can listen to the lectur faster and it just save me a lot of time i am also more motiv when i decid that i want to do someth and not when i have to do it on a certain day at a certain point of time
easier
it’ more engag and challeng and it’ the coldest to physic class
interact with other peopl
i enjoy be abl to interact with my teacher and classmat and ‘recreate’ the classroom set through an onlin platform otherwis it feel isol also learn materi from the teacher directli is much more engag then be assign onli read and assign without ani actual real instruct time
you get to see your teacher and hear them speak thi make it more engag and you understand the inform more clearli also it’ easier to ask question
actual feel like i’m still be taught and less on my own definit get more out of lesson taught in thi way
it mean i don’t miss anyth the lectur would’v said in addit to slide in a real lectur which is what i take note of instead of onli the slide which aren’t as use
becaus you can ask question and get an immedi respons it also keep you engag and prevent distract
becaus it’ the most interact mode
interact with the lectur and classmat better reflect the experi of the real life classroom
can do in your own time but still interact
i can replay it whenev i want and also rematch a part of in case i didnt understand someth
most similar to real life class
becaus it structur your time abd you can ask question if in doubt
social interact i’m an extrovert
given the fact that not everyon ha the opportun to join live class record lectur guarante that all the student will have the opportun to benefit from the teacher lesson moreov we have the chanc to post doubt if ani

abl to discuss and ask question straight away if we dont understand and is more interact
it is easier to structur my time when the materi are uploadedemail which make is easier to stay focus it is my prefer mode as long as i get feedback from teacher
the closest thing to actual have a seminar
live session give student the abil to ask question there and then to aid with understand
allow for better understand and contribut of idea
it’ more effect and it keep me concetr
more like a normal lesson for me
the student have the chanc to ask question and everybodi benefit
it’ interact i learn best by do and discuss the work in tutori and with my lectur and peer
you get to ask question and work through a problem togeth without confus explan through email which you have to tri and get your head round
it’ the onli one i have experienc and it’ work pretti well as we can see clearli what we have to do and can email our teacher for help if we need it
it feel more like you’r in back in the lectur hall
i dont like video chat have a bad wifi signal sometim and my laptop webcam isnt work so talk with my class and tutor via messag is easier for me
it is clear and well detail and i can still go back and rewatch content that i didn’t understand
don’t feel pressur into give answer quickli
with record session i can paus where i want and take time to fulli understand the contentl class are too fast pace for me
easi to follow can do at whatev time abl to speed up record
some of my teacher onli use meet as a way of get support dure lesson and not actual teach through meet they upload materi onto googl classroom and it let me go at my own pace
it can easili be pair with work in a share doc or with email resourc howev it is vital for effect learn to be abl to ask question and have a respons immedi when cover new content and live class are the best way to achiev thi
semi human interact and tri to replic a classroom it best can
easi and more access to all of the class
i feel i can manag my time better
more interact
onli mode we have
most similar to physic class at school
becaus it’ the onli one we’r offer
more flexibl and i don’t have to be onlin at ani certain time
make it more seriou
i dont like be in video call
it replic the environ of a real classroom as much as possibl and have set time that i need to log on and learn help keep structur
i like that i can watch it whenev i want to paus and rewind the video to take note
resembl the actual class then most
interact is possibl
i can do in my own time and pace
live class
i do a practic base art degre and have had no feedback on the direct of my work and have had no contact from teacher outsid of email which take about 3 week to get a repli for
zoom is more effect for tutori and workshop so you can ask the lectur question to help with your understand wherea put the audio up is good for lectur howev i feel if we are go to learn from home there should be more tutori and workshop
it is the most similar to what i would receiv normal even with facetofac teach most of our lectur are record so we can review them later if need
you are abl to stop your lectur write someth down and go on when you are readyso you can make the most of your time
it’ the onli mode we use
better support
it still enabl you to speak directli to a teacher addit there’ a sens of togeth within the class consid we haven’t seen each other for a while
im free to decid how i want do to thing
i find thi method more use as you can paus the video and take a moment to think about it you have the materi avail for whenev you want and to follow your own rhythm but i think that it ha to be complement with onlin meet at least onc a week with the professor
becaus our teacher dont realli structureplan out work for zoom meet so they are mostli wast of time
i can take as much time as i need to fulli understand the content
i get more control over my own schedul and i can fastforward and paus the video to go at my own pace
becaus it the most similar to real tutori
i am good at learn by myself at my own pace so without eg have to paus the record lectur video to take a break or live class
i studi better when particip and not just listen
more effici in term of ask teacher question
you get to appli your knowledg and learn from other
feel much more interact we can particip and it’ much more similar to the classroom environ
be live allow me to maintain my usual univers structur and also allow me to interact with my lectur also have other student attend the session at the same time make it feel like you are learn as a group even though we dont talk
you can ask question there and then and hold discuss i feel like it’ the most like the classroom even though it will never be as good as that one to one teach
can paus and have a break doesn’t matter about wifi crack up as it’ live so don’t miss anyth sometim with live lectur the screen can be blurri or lag and with record lectur thi doesn’t happen
enabl better understand of materi and feel like a face to face interact
even though record lectur were conveni i miss seminar discuss and “face to face” chat with our tutor if we had ani question etc
more room for discuss share thought
can interact with teacher and student easili to discuss what we’r learn
i had no live lesson
didn’t experi it but i think it would’v been more effect
interact with teacher is easier
more effici commun closest to actual classroom learn
make me pay more attent to what’ be taught
thi seem to work the best and it’ also conveni that you can easili rewatch later on
becaus i find it is the most effici take the least of my time as oppos to upload materi which take longer to fulli comprehend
keep me on schedul it is interact
it feel more engag and ha the option to be interact
it interact and i can ask my teacher whatev i want like class at school
creat some interact between student and lectur i studi music at univers so thi enabl some practic element too which might not be as effici through discuss forum and chat
more person and easi to ask question
natur interact is key also whoever teach doe it best when abl to react to their audienc
i can watch it in my own pace
easier to engag
interact with the teacher and classmat
it allow for class discuss to continu throughout onlin learn if you were engag it wa almost like actual be there in class
i haven’t experienc the other mode an i like the flexibl of self work
can take my time and paus it also i can do it whenev i like
better explan of the work and work through exampl rather than just set task
live class
becaus you can ask the professor if you didn’t understand right away you don’t need to send an email or someth
the teacher can give a good explan and i learn better when i see the teacher not by upload document also zoom meet are awkward
you can actual see peopl and teacher
becaus it keep me engag and at least i feel like i’m in class mayb
it allow me to set my own time schedul prevent ani restrict as a result of time constraint on the teacher part eg a zoom call could probabl onli be held for 1 hour whilst work by email could contain entir powerpoint for you to go through as if the teacher wa teach over a longer time period
as you can ask question live thi wa veri handi for me as i have a lot of math in my cours
you can ask question directli to the lectur and it will be explain there and then it is also the closest thing to actual be in a room learn even if it is onlin
of all option thi one feel closest to an actual classroom
the abil to ask question live is more appropri to my style of learn it is more engag
interact with peer and tecah
with record lectur i am abl to follow them at my own pace and watch them when i have time
i can ask the teacher for help face to face when i need it
i can work through at my own pace to make sure i understand everyth but also give me the chanc to email teacher ani question i have
feel like tutor have to actual somewhat engag as oppos to upload old document with no input or feedback
my univers use a combin of all four method but it’ easier to understand assign and concept with a lectur explain in real time and answer question
live class are much more interact and the lectur can dedic more time to those area of the materi that the student understand less thi isn’t possibl dure record lectur from my experi as they just rush through everyth and don’t tailor their teach to what would be more benefici for the student
it is more repres of a lesson in school rather than just read through inform you are abl to commun with other and discuss the contentask question
i can rewatch at a later date if need
i haven’t been offer anyth els
real time motiv to do the classwork
allow for more activ learn and interact
it allow me to ask question
it is interact and requir focus think
interact with classmat and teacher i miss it
most of my instructor make sure that these lesson are interact and sometim even discuss so we have room to do what we want to do while also get time to ask explor and learn for ourselv
have someon physic explain the materi to me is realli use but when they do it over live chat thing can move too quickli i like be abl to go back and take note or review
it simul usual class and allow me to listen see and write note which help me rememb the materi more than a live video or upload note
it more interact and help stay motiv as you are directli in relat with the teacher
i can interact with my lectur and ask question if need
it easier to access and is avail throughout the day and so can fit it around household chore
abl to listentak note at own speed
straight to the point teach me the content can go at my own past and rewind or speed up it lack student collabor but i learn faster definit doe not encourag independ thought though
we can go back and paus if we need to dont have it rn tho😭
i prefer record lectur becaus i like to paus the video to take note of everyth import that can be hard sometim if the teacher talk to fast and also if i dont understand someth i can just go back and watch it again
i can work wheni want where i want and how fast or slow i want
i can re read it anytim i want
i can do it in my own time i dont have to speak onlin to peopl i have more control
no pressur of be present especi in a time like thi not particularli a fan of have to feel the pressur of contribut significantli so i like to learn in my own time on my own
it allow me to work on my own schedul
enabl the teacher to explain better and you can ask question
it’ easier to commun with my teacher through thi mode
becaus in a lot of my lesson you just talk about variou subject in your person life or you have to pitchpres someth to the rest of the class
easier and becaus of commit with famili i find it hard to attend onlin class
it’ more interact and you can learn more by have more convers rather than just not commun and be email assign instead
becaus it is more or less the onli one our univers use
you can work through it at your own pace when you want
i like to get involv and be abl to discuss topic with my lectur
i can do it in my own time but i am still get ‘access’ to my lectur i studi languag so hear them speak my target languag help
more engag and particip
becaus i can make all note requir
forc you into a schedul you have to attend at a specif time
it give me the motiv to be present at that time rather than just leav it until later
i dont have to make my own note
it easier to stick to a routin also you can ask question the moment they aris
so i can listen at my prefer speed and paus when need
can do it at my own pace
allow me to work in my own time effect commun larg amount of content
face to face and can ask question whenev i like
direct contact with the teacher
allow me to do thing at my own pace
easier to ask question so learn quicker than have to email everi time with question
make me stick to a schedul and get some human interact
i can have contact with my teacher when they just upload work for me to do they dont mark anyth or give ani feedback
it is so much easier to work at your own pace especi with mess up sleep schedul
11 interact
more commun and proactiv interact
it help me understand it more
mixtur of resourc record lectur and then live class
can take it at your own pace whilst have a teacher talk you through the work
i benefit most from learn in a convers way and find a live call is easiest for teacherstud interact and mimic a classroom dynam
becaus it allow for discuss and so you can ask question to that are relev at time it also mean you can ask for clarif rather than just be confus and later realis you were go at the question the wrong way
you can work on your own tempo and watch the video in fast forward
you can receiv live feedback from tutor
it allow for question and discuss to take place in real time allow for better understand of the subject and enabl us to ask question freeli
i prefer thi mode becaus it allow teacher to maintain a realist view and thu not leav an unrealist amount of workload also it allow us as student to make question as soon as we have doubt and therefor we don’t have to wait as long as you would have if you had to send an email
a bigger senc of comun
i like be abl to ask question in the moment and see other peopl as i don’t have small group seminar
it allow me to move at my own pace
can actual engag and it’ most like normal school
interact can ask question and get respons straight away i seem to rememb thing better when can discuss and easier to engag
allow me to work how and when i want to so if i begin to feel overwhelm i can take a break and it doesn’t matter
probabl the closest thing you can get to face to face teach
i prefer to work independ thu have to attend live class interrupt with my product especi in a a home set where my attent is even more lacklust than in a classroom
more focus and use
i can work through the materi at my own pace
interact
you get to interact with your teacher and ask question without a delay respons
more interact
becaus they are live it make me have to go to them otherwis i just put it off
i can organ myself like i want i don’t have to attend live class earli in the morn and i can choos when to work and by myself
i feel more connect to the teacher and i can ask question about the topic theyr explain
you can discuss and ask question but don’t have the embarrass of peopl see you on live video
it feel like actual sit in a classroom instead of be in your own at home it motiv me more
get better contact with the lectur keep you motiv to attend and keep up with work
i find it veri hard to particip in and also concentr on zoom lectur and i much prefer look at the powerpoint in my own tone rather than on zoom
becaus i dont find watch my teacher on a screen veri engag
you get a better understand when some talk about a subject
thi way of studi encourag student to built a convers with teacher about differ topicsalso might be a good way to know your real understand of differ concept
our teacher can answer our question and involv us in real time there’ an opportun for collabor that make live class incred similar to irl class
dont trust my famili not to start a scream match dure a live lesson
becaus there is still some level of disciplin involv and i don’t have an option to procrastin realli
i understand the theme of the lectur better thi way
more commun and support avail instantli
easi to use and allow the class to run like normal
social interact abil to ask question and feel more like a normal lesson
have a teacher explain someth face to face ha alway been easier for me they can do exercis with you or help you directli you don’t have to wait for an email repli thi is help sinc when you’r emerg in « the zone » and you’r work effici have live feedback is so much easier then have to wait when you wait you sometim forget what you were stuck with it’ just less effect
easi to paus and go back when you don’t catch someth first time you can stop and write down an adjac topic the professor ha made you think of flag up someth for review later without miss ani content
becaus it is close similar to when have lectur and tutori in person
record lectur are bore and imperson and there is a need to paus and write everyth down but with zoom lectur better interact and easier to ask question particip which mean i feel like i understand the content better
more interact and easier to engag with the lectur and my peer
becaus if i have ani question i can ask the teacher immedi and not to wait hour for a respond the teacher explain way more better and shehe can show materi and other suppli that could help us understand the lesson better
you get to actual listen to the teacher and see them but they cannot see you as a person deal with social anxieti i learn much better thi way becaus im not as stress out as i am when in class
i like be abl to ask question
it’ easier to ask question and harder to get distract
thi way i can learn at my own pace
it is veri obviou what you have to do and it’ all alreadi there for you
becaus i can go back if i don’t understand someth or replay it a lot of time i feel less anxiou and find that thi method work better than live class for some subject
i can work independ
can be sped up or paus as need to take note feel like my learn is more effici thi way
more person
im more of a visualkinet learner so find interact tea thing more benefici compar with just learn from onlin powerpoint or textbook
it more conveni becaus you can watch the lectur when you feel like it
i have the possibl to consult the materi everytim i need it
it‘ more interact therefor easier to rememb associ with other term or concept live discuss help w take on other perspect and be abl to dive a lot deeper into certain topic
becaus it doe not allow me to procrastin
explan are clearer
can discuss content with teacher
i get to ask question live
easier to follow
technolog often fail and it is the onli mode that i am use to
i take in the knowledg more as if it wa a normal lesson instead of miss someth and get distract
interact
becaus there is pressur to do work i alway forget to contribut to discuss board
easier to do work when it is schedul
it would allow us to interact with the teacher and to ask question and check understand
interact with teacher
it’ so much easier when thing are be explain verbal
it’ the most engag and is the most like normal lesson
if i have ani question the teacher can answer it immedi and it is like normal school lesson
it forc me to sit and engag rather than put off thing or get distract
you still have independ to organis time but it easier to understand work as it be explain to you
i can studi at my own pace and feel less pressur than in a live class
it easier to grasp more difficult concept consid i take scienc subject as it is be activ explain to me and im allow to paus andor rewind the video to take note or to go back over a concept i wasnt sure about
it feel more person and direct easier to understand
more interact teacher can explain in depth
it’ the easiest way for me to understand the content
it ha more room for debat and engag in class than the other
i find onlin lesson quit stress i prefer to correspond by email
can go through the materi at my pace
it a form of human contact
more engag
the peopl who want to turn up will and so discuss will be more in depth and engag
i can listen to them whenev i want eg when i am more focus
convien but still be taught

i have been set record video befor but they are difficult to concentr in with set work i just do it at my own pace
just use to it i guess
becaus it simul the univers experi best
they are more straight to the point instead of peopl distract one anoth on live class
interact
i like to see everyon and it feel most like a normal lesson also the work set for the time frame is more accur
gener form more like a lectur and provid the necessari inform for the degre instead of shift through endless resourc for the same inform
i can interact properli with the teacher and the lesson
that’ the way it’ alway been done it also mean i get to engag with the materi in my own time
resembl normal teach more close i am an audiovisu learner so hear it explain aloud help me to understand and retain inform
less awkward and can access at ani time
it allow me to paus and play to make sure i get all the inform i need
the interact is much more valuabl for my learn and process of concept
real life interact debat question can be ask discuss
i still feel like i’m learn in a similar way sinc i can sit and spend the time on a lectur with the lectur input
can rewind speed up and studi at own pace
i can focu my time on the work at hand instead of wait through a slow and tediou zoom class that take up more time than necessari
pre record video allow me to structur my time accordingli with the routin of my famili it mean that if i’m in the middl of do product work i don’t need to stop to go watch a video which is live
discuss with professorsclassm is the best way to be engag with and understand the materi
allow easier interact between teacher and student compar to have to learn content independ
can go through it at my own pace
easi to follow
it make everyth more organis im get lost at all the live chat and need more structur to stay motiv
you can commun with the teacher
i don’t like ani of them but at least thi way i can watch on my own time and paus when i need to or watch on doubl speed it offer me the most flexibl but again i haven’t found a singl method of onlin learn that i’v enjoy so far
becaus i do the task by myself and i feel free to take break
have schedul class make you more motiv to work becaus you’r be held account unlik with record class where you can just miss them and nobodi will know
becaus it feel more like real seminar than work through materi by yourself
ensur routin and highlight problem in real time
easier to follow along and i find im more motiv when cours were conduct thi way
i can see it more than onc
forc you to pay more attent is much more schedul can get help much more easili
easi to keep up with can paus and replay part
more time to answer question individu with ani work set
it’ good to see peopl my teacher and be abl to talk to them face to face and it’ also easier to express problem than over email
it just great it feel like were in the classroom and also veri import we could ask doubt and they will be clear at that veri moment sorri for the bad english 😬
caus i can see what is go on and is easier to have the slidesinform there for me to add to or chang it is even more ideal when they send these out and do a live chat at the same time go over it all like in a normal lectur
i can learn at my own pace
it’ becaus it mean i can go back through stuff at my own pace and realli make sure i’m learn and make note of everyth but i onli like it when it’ done via a compani which know how to male onlin lectur my actual uni’ onlin lectur are aw becaus they’r just previou year’ lectur which have been reupload to echo mean that we don’t get the most out of them becaus they’r onli design to be rewatch if you miss the lectur irl not to be learnt from
simpl and can be look at in my own time
it is harder to concentr dure onlin lectur so it is cool to be abl to go back to a certain topic you didnt get the first time also mani professor seem to be quit uncomfort with zoom
i also like zoom but record lectur combin with qa session provid me with the possibl to learn the materi at my own speed work with zoom lesson i often struggl to keep concentr
i can do it whenev i am free
becaus you can connect with peopl and bounc of each other
becaus i can go back to the class anytim i want or if i miss it i can watch it onlin
abl to ask question in real time with teacher present
it give me enough time to prepar myself as well as a lot of freedom i can choos when i want to do what for how long etc
becaus i think that peopl are alredi go trought enough and studi isnt and shouldnt be the first thing on their mind thi way in my school everyth wa kinda easi and the teacher were realli nice and want to help with everyth
i find it easier to explain my question by talk than write it down and easier to understand answer if it is spoken to me rather than written down in an email
that the onli one weve had 😂
i can interact with my teacher easili
you get to studi in your own time when it suit you and you get the time to process all the inform hand to you
becaus you can do everyth at your own pace
becaus it’ the closest to normal face to face teach
it is easier to schedul your day base on your prefer record lesson can be slow down or speed up depend on the lecturer’ voic and pace it allow me to focu better and break the materi more effici
you can ask the teacher question and they are answer straight away i also feel connect to the class
more freedom to go back over lectur freedom to creat one’ own schedul
it best mimic the in class environ
it give more opportun for discuss and bounc idea off of other student
abil to ask question live and have convers but you are abl to go back and look at the respons
thi is the onli mode of onlin teach i have experienc
so that you could look back if you don’t understand and also have it in our own speed
you can ask the teacher question and you dont have to wait long for a respons
interact and more engag more like to focu with less opportun for procrastin as you have to engag with the content there and then if it is a live zoom call meet
interact actual allow me to talk to my professor and ask question i have in real time
i like to be present when the lectur actual is be given becaus if i skip it and have to watch the record version i tend to procrastin more howev have them record is also help to rewatch someth you didn’t understand
it is more engag and easier to be on time with everyth
they are easi to follow along you can go back if you don’t understand and go at your own pace
can ask question directli
i like that i get to interact with my peer and professor my cours are primarili discuss base so live class allow us to have discuss we also use breakout room in zoom so we can have small group discuss which make it seem more like normal in person class
i feel as though i benefit more from it
be abl to interact with teacher in the moment send email can becom tediou and respons time is long
easier mode of commun with my teacher if i have ani problem or question easier for them to get across to the class the context we are learn
it’ more person and i can get on with it myself without pressur from other
it’ all there for me to do as i pleas
i can wait well independ and ask for help off friend or teacher by text
most interact
can do it whenev you like less internet issu and just like be in class can go at your own pace and ask question after
i like to work independ at my own pace
more straight forward way of get assign without convers go off topic irrelevantli by other student
i like interact with peopl i find live chat etc and forum kind of isol
becaus the teacher can go through the cours better and we get a better understand from it
live class are most similar to actual class in school and the instructor can for the most part conduct a regular lesson
i like be present when other ask question dure the class that i may not be think about myself but when they ask the question i find it realli help thi cant happen with record lectur and onlin post materi
it’ much easier to engag with as it’ harder to get distract and if i have question i can easili ask them
is far more interact and engag is greater opportun to ask question and gain answer in real time
zoom
it make it a commit to attend the lectur in a way that prerecord lectur don’t as you can watch them whenev help me reduc procrastin
live interact with tutor proper engag in the content
we get to ask question and we get to know if we understood or not
becaus you can listen to the lesson in the moment that you prefer
engag and provid abil to speak directli with teacher
teacher can explain inform in more depth and you can ask question more easili
the teacher can teach and explain concept face to face and so i dont feel lost
i feel like it would help class engag in work togeth and it would help us as pupil understand the work better it would also help peopl who are not do the work
social interact
it is the closest possibl format of onlin learn to face to face learn
it’ easier to ask your teacher question on thing you don’t understand in “person” than in an email but also have live lectur forc to keep up with the work as well as have a reason to get out of bed
i like have the feel of face to face interact with a teacher and peersalso the idea of have a set deadlin and time to be present realli work for meiv found how big a role enforc routin with school play to help maintain my motiv
person i onli have live class but i alway record them becaus it help me to revis and comprehend the subject better
you can easili do the work at your own speed paus the video or watch part back to understand the topic i can listen to them when ever i want and can crate my own schedul
you get to ask question easier to understand
i realli like interact with peopl see my classmatesprofessor made my class seem more real and tangibl
more interact question can be ask and you feel more inclin to actual keep up and complet work
i prefer be abl to watch record lectur and then join dicuss wil alreadi form knowledg as i can ask question about a topic i alreadi have an insight into
i like the continu as it’ veri similar to befor everyth wa onlin and we can alway email lectur with question or issu
i can paus the video if confus
most relax and fluid
you can have more discuss unlik when work is upload or email
you can complet it at ani time
it is flexibl
it forc me to actual watch the class and stay on track
i work better at my own pace and be abl to read materi help me
more engag and the encourag from lectur and fellow peer to do the readingcont
i find it a lot easier to watch or listen to someon rather than read it myself
i would love have good live class in which not onli question are answer but the learn materi is also discuss i prefer record lectur becaus they are straight to the point and explain materi in a short effect way onli downsid is that you cant easili ask question
i can go back an rewatch the lectur
i can watch back at my own rythm in live class i normal record them and watch them back becaus i need time to process the inform
it is the closest version to the classroom i can achiev from home while be abl to complet the work set at my own pace
in person class
it’ the most interact i think i would be more focus and would work harder than if i wa work alon becaus of support of other student and staff as well as the pressur to be engag
i like the flexibl of be abl to choos when to do the work as oppos to at a specif time
can watch back if don’t understand materi and can do in own time
becaus you can chat and say your opinion as when you were in class
i am now accustom to the onlin tool of googl hangout and have onli use thi platform for onlin school
becaus you can go through at your own pace when it conveni to you but with a proper explan the text book doesnt give
thi give me the possibl to replay certain topic which we get told about in class you can take everyth at your own pace and are not reli on your classmat
record lectur give more detail than onli the note and make it easier to follow
i prefer more interact with the instructor eg by ask question dure the lectur
becaus it is the onli mode i have use thi past month
it’ easier to understand what the teacher is say or what they want you to do
you can go at your own pace which wasn’t as easi for some at school
when the class are live i am much more like to actual focu dure the lesson with pre record class i lose focu veri quickli
you can paus it whenev you want so you can studi at your own pace
i don’t think live class work for me becaus i get distract veri easili and email or upload materi give me the freedom to work at my own pace also i like to manag my time and i realli prefer work autonom
easi and i don’t mind teach myself
more direct and interact
becaus i can ask question as i’m learn
my cours ha a combin of prerecord lectur and live tutori via zoom i do prefer live class becaus it allow me to interact with my classmat and tutor breakout room share whiteboardscreen etc
it’ the most similar to real life teach question can be solv at the moment
short concis abl to ask question immedi and not have anxieti about read feedback
becaus of the avail to watch all the time need and in the prefer time
live class are realli help but i feel that record lectur and video are import in case you have to miss the lesson for a specif reason it’ also use to look back at to make sure you’r achiev all aim of the assign that you have been given
i can ask question dure the lesson rather than email afterward
you get to interact with class member and teacher in real time and the lesson feel much more tailor to you than a record video
becaus sometim my internet connect doe not work properli
i can access at anytim and becaus sometim i dont have a stabl internet connect
can discuss thing and it feel like a classroom environ
explain topic a lot better
it easier to understand someth when someon is actual explain oral rather than onli read it
it simul a learn environ
ita easier to understand inform when it deliv face to face
i can work at my own pace
not alot of peopl join on the zoom
i work to a schedul that is comfort and conveni for me whilst still receiv the benefit of lectur content
more structur than record lectur which you can watch at ani time so less procrastin
becaus it is veri hard to constantli concentr on live class but when it is record you can pauz the video when you are distract
closest to an inperson lectur
abl to activ particip and ask question
teacher were abl to upload content directli suit to our need and syllabu wherea textbook materi is not as syllabu specif onlin platform for live class were not permit in my school
can be watch over to improv understand
i can paus to take note
i can directli ask question but without email materi i cant realli do much
it the most similar to normal class and you can ask question and get answer immedi
becaus i still feel like i am have a lesson in person but i’m not and i’m actual learn from my teacher thi way
as it is live it motiv me to join there and then if left to my own devic to catch up on prerecord lectur i’d struggl to find motiv
thi method allow me to understand the inform more effect
you can go back easili and listen again
becaus it allow me to go back and watch anyth i need to and make as specif note as i can and ask question on thing i don’t understand
it allow you to get much more materi than with just a call with the professor
i feel anxiou go on a zoom call
it nice to have discuss and debat with teacher particularli as i do rs and histori
structur but own pace clear what you need to do and no technic difficulti
in direct convers with teacher and in live time the teacher is awar of the amount of work we are abl to complet dure the lesson
can be done at anytim but still get teacher instruct and explan
it is easiest to understand and download
find zoom call intimid at time
be abl to interact with my peer and teacher to help build upon my current knowledg
becaus you get to discuss and cooper with other
help to listen to the teacher explain but i can paus and don’t have the pressur of them ask me question
then i could manag my time by myself
it easi to access and i am abl to go at my own pace
give your day structur and you’r forc to stay engagedconcentr
i prefer record lectur as im abl to replay whatev it is and we were given time to realli understand it plu gain some idea and question to share with other dure anoth class
it’ more interact and i get the inform verbal which is better person
thi is veri visual and interact which is good for do a fashion cours it mean you can show exampl and have class discuss
conveni
it is effici and you can understand the assign you need to do
i work at a fast pace and find live lesson slow me down from complet my work quickli howev i understand some lesson requir engag and am will to particip in them
i am abl to watch a video more than onc and can concentr on everi detail
i prefer talk to peopl face to face
you can learn in your own time and i am abl to get the core piec of knowledg that i need befor do a zoom discuss lesson
becaus with it limit it’ the most interact way
becaus it fell more like be in the real classroom and you can be activ and ask cuestion
it allow me to learn at my own pace and pausereplay when need
i can ask question easier
a lot more control easier to organis work
replic face to face contact abl to talk to tutor
when it is live i can directli ask question and live class bring structur in my day
easier to ask question you have to show up for class so it give you some motiv your teacher teach you someth instead of you have to figur it all out by yourself as you have to do when you just get assign nice to seehear your class and teacher
get to commun with teacher
you can access it whenev you can and work on your own pace
becaus it is harder to follow live class
i get anxiou use zoom and have meet over video call i understand whi it’ use but for some reason they just fill me with dread i’d much rather have the materi upload so i can look at it myself and then contribut into a forum
i think it easier but also quicker than onlin class where the teacher ha to stop everi two minut to answer 20 question at a time yeah
becaus it’ realli similar to actual attend class and i tend to find it more appeal than studi uploadedemail materi on my own
work can be set for the whole week so i can plan ahead and that make me less stress
becaus i can paus and rewind and take my time to realli process the inform
easier to directli commun with teacher
deep legal of understand and abil to form more solid judgment
becaus as an intern student it help me to interact with my fellow student and practic english it also take less time compar to independ studi
becaus i dont like to teach myself even when i have materi that help me get the new topic i prefer someon to talk to so that i can ask question it feel more like normal school to me
it felt the most like be in an actual classroom
more engag
becaus i can look back at the materi whenev i find it hard or i didnt understand it fulli
you can ask your teacher question in that moment and get a further explan of it while if it’ a record video or email it is sometim harder to do thi
allow for stricter routin more like to actual watch them
i can choos to work at my prefer time of day
at a set time so im more like to engag
it is the onli mode i have use
it gave us the opportun to view the class at our conveni and time to consid question befor ask
it’ the closest resembl to real lesson and replic the classroom feel rel well
i can actual learn instead of stress and teach myself content
it allow discuss and question that allow a deeper understand than other method of teach
live class becaus you immedi get an answer to your question it also creat a rutin when you have to join a meet at a certain time also misunderstand are less like when a teacher give an appoint lastli it veri nice to see friend through onlin class on a daili basi it make me feel less lone
make me feel somewhat product if it wa all just onlin lectur record i’d do no work
easier to procrastin
it is easier to commun with the teacher
id probabl feel awkward do a live class onlin but it probabl better to have more contact with teacher
i’m work a fulltim job at the moment so wouldn’t be abl to attend class that have live lectur dure the day also though thi doesn’t affect me as i’m in the same time zone as my uni i think it’ unfair to expect student scatter across differ time zone to join a live lectur in the middl of the night
get more contact time with lectur and can ask them question in person
it’ easier to take note and understand
it’ easier to ask question in a live class rather than a record one
becaus in case youv miss someth or need to hear the explan again you can alway go back and watch the part of the video where the professor is explain that particular thing it also super help with the video where teacher solv exercis
actual make you do work can ask teacher question can get instant feedback as a languag student i can practis speak and listen
easier to understand with some explan of the content
becaus it can be access at ani time in the day and allow the teacher to explain a concept easili
asynchron mode of teach allow everyon to work how they prefer live class in thi context are just unnecessari
more interact you can ask question in realtim and it feel like a normal classroom environ
you can ask question directli to the lectur and it will be explain there and then it is also the closest thing to actual be in a room learn even if it is onlin
becaus my professor keep chang time make it confus
it is more interact and allow for instant feedback
can ask question whilst be explain
can watch in my own time
it is the onli thing my colleg have offer and i havent experienc anyth els
you have more control over learn
easier to interact and ask question and get an instant answer also feel more like normal face to face lectur
i can studi and understand on my own the lesson and then ask question if i need to dure onlin class the professor just take so much more time to explain anyth to everyon and peopl are disturb so they ask to repeat and the entir class is a mess
im a visual learner so video help me understand the topic without wast ani time which usual happen dure live class
i like the facetofac contact and i know i wouldn’t watch the lectur if my presenc wouldn’t be monitor
i feel more apart of the experi when we have live class as to when i am email work to do with littl to no guidanc
i feel that it most close resembl what an actual lectur is like i feel like i’v been rob of a univers experi in so mani way that thi would be a small consol for all of the mess we’v been subject to thi year strike etc
it’ realli good for interact purpos be abl to ask question and inquir in more detail
watch it in my own time and i feel more focus be abl to paus the video and properli understand thing
you can ask ani question and get a respons straight away i studi music perform so have to have live instrument lesson becaus it would be imposs to learn otherwis
becaus it’ more interact and the other colleg i see do it are learn a lot more success than us just copi off a powerpoint
i can go at my own pace creat my work how i like to ie make note on paper organis it better and can still ask for help if i need it also becaus i haven’t experienc it ani other way
can paus and start when you want to make more use of the materi given to you
more interact and more person most like classroom teach
more interact
you can go back to it if miss easier to catch up with
allow me to go back over the inform be taught and to go at my own pace to ensur that i don’t miss anyth out
closest to inperson interactionlectur while still access to differ timezon
can interact live with teacher and class but no pressur with have to speakb seen in your hous
interact with teach will mean i can understand thing better just someon explain thing help
it the onli one where i have a sens of instant connect with my tutor and peer
onli more avail
it is the best method to emul the real classroom experi
be abl to paus and work at your own pace
it make me concentr a lot more becaus the teacher make sure you are listen and i just understand the content more when it’ be talk through with me
give me a structur to my day when i have to attend a live class
it allow you to ask question live
i can do the work at my own pace and time i can have my own routin
less pressur and give you more time to go over materi thoroughli
live class are quit exhaust and tire as you need to be concentr all the time and sometim background noisesslow internet connect are make it more difficult to understand upload materi allow me to work independ and at ani time i want
better explan thi way
it is much easier to wrap your head around the more difficult a level content when you have someon explain it to you even via record lectur rather than worksheet and email materi
allow more question to be ask in a more inform way whilst allow a similar structur to that we are use to from in person class
i can have my own schedul and studi when i want
i like that it’ more flexibl than live class it mean that i have more control over my studi schedul especi in these chaotic time
it give me time to work at my own pace
it’ easier to commun and ask question
becaus i can organis my schedul better when i have assign
video allow you to paus and make note and you do not have to answer question on the spot like in live class
it give the most interact and most like normal
it’ the most similar way in relat to actual lesson
i get chanc to fulli understand the materi befor move on
on a person level these live class are enjoy as they allow me to connect with my teacher and classmat and help to uphold some sort of connect to school life within my new routin they make it easier to preserv focu and structur in thi new type of school day academ speak i find it much easier to take in and comprehend inform when it is explain directli by my teacher and i have a chanc to ask question and engag with the materi have a teacher there to push me and ask me question i might not have previous consid allow me to grow more academ than if i wa work on the materi on my own
it motiv me the most to particip and make engag with the other student possibl it is also much quicker to get feedback
the social aspect with all my friend
you still get face to face contact
i would feel like i am actual learn someth and could interact with teacher
it’ easi and you can paus and rewatch it you can also chang speed of video
can actual activ engag
haven’t had experi of video call or record lectur at all but upload materi is easi to follow and work through there is less discuss but i think i would find it difficult to fulli develop idea with peopl if i wasn’t in the classroom set
i am an auditori learner and learn best from audibl materi so video and onlin lectur are best for me
no distract can paus and take note
give you more motiv to actual do the lectur there’ less structur when do the record lectur
can learn at my own pace given that i find it hard to stick to a routin and get distract by other thing veri easili zoom class and discuss board realli just allow for applic or clarif of that knowledg learnt
i can replay as mani time as i want to understand
i am an independ worker and i like to just get on with the work and tri to teach myself
more person and similar to standard teach
sinc i would be abl to reflect on what we have learnt dure the lesson prior to onlin learn and also the onlin lesson we had dure onlin learn it help to reinforc the inform that i had learnt and made me studi more and understand the lesson more effici to be abl to produc the best assign i can
interact and feel normal
beceaus you can have a real live discuss about the topic
becaus i can chose when i want to watch the lectur and there is no set time i guess
it is a lot more motiv and give you a time to go through each of the lectur
u can paus and rewind and alter the speed and watch over and it’ also semi face to face
i find that i can then work at my own pace in the time i want
more structur and less technic issu occur
contact with teacher
becaus it allow for more freedom regard pay attent the way we learn the lesson and the way we organ ourselv which i realli like it also give me the possibl to do addit research more easili and i can alway ask my teacher question but overal my favorit aspect is just the freedom it give me
more like an actual class environ can ask question have group discuss in real time
becaus it allow us to work on our own be independ and come foward if we have ani doubt
the abil to access and reaccess in your own time you might miss a point dure a live class and then your unabl to go back also there a pressur to tri and write note whilst also contribut which can lead to thing be easili miss allow student to work at their own pace more access for student with mental health condit eg anxieti disord who may struggl to attend and contribut dure live session less awkward there is just someth quit weird and uncomfort sometim about the live class format it feel somehow more obviou if you havent contribut and your constantli forc to analys and think about your own contribut to the session feel the most like the tradit univers experi student learn better at differ time of day and so forc some student to wake up earli to engag in a session might be utterli useless to them bc they are abl to focusconcentr much better later on in the day record lectur allow student to tailor their learn experi to what best fit them
interact
just easier to look at when need
as close to be in person as you can
i find i work better with someon els teach me rather than an email especi for centain subject such as a languag therefor i prefer video or record
can be refer back to as mani time as i want which is better than a live call but upload materi as well would be good
as we can learn from our own teacher and ask question when topic are be explain to us
can have convers and ask question
interact with teacher and classmat
you can ask question live and also interact with other student in small group discuss
it give us a chanc to ask question in real time when our tutor are explain someth thi help by ensur that the tutor clarifi someth that they havent explain properli or need to elabor becaus they’v been too brief have live class also mean that tutor can add anyth into the present and resourc which they share afterward if they feel like dure the live class they haven’t includ someth which we may need to write an assign on
i can take time to fulli understand the topic and paus the video to take note or process the inform
record video are a wast of time as lectur could’v just upload their origin note save time when it’ just upload document
you can talk and ask question
it live so we can intereact witch teacher ask at the same time
powerpoint lesson and video
i find it is the most similar to the real face to face lectur teach i wa get befor covid19 and i can watch the record lectur in my own time which is veri use now that i’m at home and my schedul is differ
it feel like you’r more invest and can be involv in collabor discuss also it’ fun to be around peopl
becaus in pre record video professor tend to rush through the video realli quickli and therefor have one explan if you do not understand it that is realli suck or professor take more time than the origin lectur time i have experienc both plu we were given extra assign for everi cours so it wa intens to say the least in one class the professor record the grammar and gave us exercis and we discuss the exercis live and she explain everyth in depth that is unclear
constent feedback and support live
i would find a video much more use than type intrus as a visual learner i find it harder learn a brand new topic by just read the email sent out
live
i prefer live lesson becaus you have to follow your class at a specif time when i have to watch prerecord lectur it sometim take me a coupl hour to watch a 15h lectur which isn’t veri effici
i enjoy discuss forum as i wa abl to use them to further my learn they motiv me to watch the lectur in advanc so i wa abl to engag with my lectur far more than i would do for ani other modul
the teacher can explain the content and also show powerpointssupport document in gener and we can easili ask our doubt and get the answer faster
keep me focuss and allow me to ask question and better understand concept
can watch at your own pace
•work with my cours better i think differ method work better for differ cours
encourag genuin particip rather than passiv learn
zoom
it more engag i often zone out in my lectur
learn without need to speak
more engag and you do it
can do it at my own pace and when i want to becaus for my math a level we have done some zoom but honestli i find them a bit stress know i’v got to have finish my other work by then and be readi i know that sound stupid though becaus at sixth form we obvious had set lesson but teacher are set more work than i could get done in the “hour” lesson that we would have had at colleg and that plu regular revis is pile up so i like be abl to do it at my own pace sorri for the long explan rant thing 😂 oh and i’v just come back to add to thi about the fact that we had to do our mock at home which wa veri stress 😂
i’m still an essenti worker so it allow me to juggl my schedul
you have time to studi one subject and then talk about that with the professor
it impli real time respons and actual interact and feedback enabl the student to further ask question regard the answer if they didn’t understand them first hand from the answer sheet
get real time feedback hold me account to attend and particip
i can go at my own pace without feel rush unlik in a video where ye i can paus it but if i find myself paus it everi 10 second i feel unmotiv to continu becaus i feel like i’m lag behind
my degre is project orient mean we need a lot of feedback on our work to progress live class allow us to get direct feedback from our tutorslecturersclassm and allow us to see how classmat are progress which often inspir our own work
allow for independ studi
it’ easier if someon you are use to is teach you rather than just be given work onlin
it most resembl a class in person
easier to take my own note and i can play it back as much as i like as suppos to a live class that i cant
good discuss more social contact
i am abl to ask the teacher question and be social
help is actual avail when you need it rather than sever hour or day later and it allow me to focu more even when we work independ
more person
greater interact with classmat and closest to the origin format of teach
becaus i can talk and exchang with my teacher easili
good to ask question feel interact and the chat option add a new level of discuss not seen in seminar in real life
becaus i can learn at ani timesometim i like to learn at morn sometim at even so when it’ record i just can watch it or listen it when it fit me into my dayand also i can return to it or play it again when i didn’t catch someth
time for good discuss
i dont like watch video becaus i feel like i have to rewatch part becaus i miss someth and im easili distract id rather be abl to read and highlight inform and be instruct thi way
it is hard to understand written materi and not know what are you suppos to do without have someon that explain to you while you go step by step
more help
quit an independ worker
live class were onli offer for one modul where i knew the dynam of the class didn’t suit my learn so have these zoom class record where i could watch after wa definit better for my learn and time manag
i can use my time more product
easier to get feedback or ask question
becaus i can just chill i mean i don’t love it and perder go to school but i just sit n listen and i get to interact as well
replic the classroom environ with the benefit of do the work when wa conveni for me alongsid my shift at work
allow to ask question in real time as they would come to you most like a classroom situat can have content explain in suffici detail
it’ more effect to elimin confus as the teacher goe over the studi materi and explain ani concept which they think could present challeng to us as student
can be done at a time that suit
can ask teacher directli for clarif and receiv feedback
2x speed stop read up on thing i dont understand overal comprehend more in 1 go
easi to organis and it is all in the one place abd easi to access
interact
becaus student can still interact and ask question and it feel more real when i know we listen to the same thing at the same time
it get me more motiv and remind me of the peopl my classmat with whom i am go through thi pandem it make me feel less lone i guess😉
you then still have the ‘live interaction’ part and you can still ask your question sort of facetofac
it seem more like a classroom set
i realli benefit from be abl to paus video and replay part that i didnt understand
can ask question
it’ much easier to take take note as you can rewind and watch bit again that you don’t understand
becaus it is interact
we can ask question as the lectur is take place if we don’t understand someth plu they are be record so we can still go back to them or access them if we couldn’t go to the live lectur
can get on with it in my own time and not as awkward
as an architectur student live feedback on my work is vital for me to progress with my design work and spot flaw in my idea or represent
becaus it is as close to ordinari class as possibl and you can still ask interact with the teacher and ask question
i enjoy have everyth in one place that’ easili access i think even after covid these larg drive should be made avail all the time
more interact and can ask question
can watch anytim
it is more engag and fit my studi more
i can progress at my own pace when it fit in with my schedul it a part time degre
we get to recreat the seminar dynam not exactli the same but we get to have actual back and forth convers about the content wherea the discuss board weve had to use in some other class are aw they dont replic the seminar experi at all becaus you dont have w convers it more like you write a paragraph send it and that it video call also mean there is a set time you have to complet read for and show up wherea with discuss board we have a whole week to contribut so there is a lack of convers becaus it is stagger over day and there is no incent to answer befor the day of the deadlin
feel as if it’ the most similar to be sat in a classroom can ask for help and also get multipl opinion
it’ easier to follow along with and i can paus it and rewind when i mishear someth
video qualiti is often bad it is hard to listen to a lectur record especi as sometim the powerpoint slide are not attach and it is just audio file often have to stop and restart record whilst make note sometim i cant fulli hear what the lectur is say in record so im not sure all my note are correct thi is not an issu with have print materi and note
can fit to everyone’ schedul and still contain the same level of detail sometim even more that a live lectur
abl to paus and take my own time
the abil for interact
most similar to previou teach
it forc you to be present even when there is no motiv
it doesn’t feel like i have to activ work as much i just turn up and don’t feel like i’m alon do work but with my whole class and a teacher and we’r all in it togeth
more interact easier to explain ask question
no direct commun with teacher
you can directli ask your professorteach for help and it’ probabl harder to get distract as it is a live lesson
i’m free to do my work whenev i like and can take break it also doesn’t requir a quiet hous which video chat do
more interact
constant avail access
we have last year lectur record so they have all of the inform we need in them zoom can feel a bit clunki and ineffici at the moment as peopl arent use to it
i prefer learn visual while someon is talk about it rather than just look at note
becaus it allow me to listen again to the materi
i like to refer back to the lectur so thi answer is base off of the fact that my prof record and post the lectur onlin after the live version live lectur forc me to actual attend and not procrastin the lectur
forc me to get it done at a set time so less stress also can ask ani question i have easili
can rewatch and watch lectur in my own time and at my own pace save the hassl of internet connect and camera avail for zoom etc
thing that are record beforehand are harder if you have question
zoom are veri disengag i would rather just learn the content
would motiv us to read it at first and then appli the knowledg and discuss argument moreov student might be less afraid to ask question for clarif of what they do not understand
i can choos whenev i do someth it’ nice to shedul the time myself
becaus you can effect studi you are not distract by other as in the live class and you can look up more inform as you go through the materi also you can choos your time for studi which is for me veri help as i am most activ in the even
it closest to inperson teach
i can watch it in my own time i am not afraid of connect failur wifi the qualiti of the audio and video are better i can paus the video whenev i want
i like hear and involv everyon take view answer i feel that with onlin live class thi isnt alway the case i learn best with other we learn from each other onlin class cant replac a classroom of eager student and a teacher that care
lectur sometim add in addit info even they talk through thing
it feel at least a littl bit like normal uni becaus we can ask question
you can go at your own pace yet have all the inform readi to learn
i have an attent deficit so it’ veri difficult for me to focu on class work when i’m not actual in class so live lectur is the closest thing i can get to account and such
easi to access and use i tend to have a better experi do thi
you can do question less motiv is need to do the class work you feel more connect
more interact
becaus it’ at a set time and it’ more interact
maintain routin and a bit of social interact
easier to follow along and focu
it seem the closest to in person learn
you lose less time onc a lectur is given it’a done structur
we get to see the teacher so it doesnt feel like were left alon with our work
i have my teacher explan besid the note and i can paus it make it faster if i alreadi know someth and basic use my time more product
it give room to discuss and engag in class
make you feel part of the class again is more open for question
i feel like thi is most similar to a face to face lectur and it is someth that you can go back and rewatch multipl time if you are struggl with a particular concept and you can paus it to make note etc
can’t get distract as easili and actual have to focu it’ the closest thing to be in an actual lectur
more motiv and faster you can directli ask question you also feel less lone or alon
becaus it allow me to work at my own pace without the anxieti of have to be in a live call
wasnt given the opportun to use other mode quit nervou share my thought in class so record lectur are nicer as you can directli email the lectur afterward with specif question
can do it in your own time and at your own pace
can revisit the sourc at ani time
becaus i can ask question and have them solv immedi
it’ easier to follow along
becaus you get to ask question and feel more “normal”
more interact can creat debat and discuss peopl are also more like to join in with a zoom live class than a discuss chat
with have these type of class one can engag as much as one like and it also becom like a mictur between all the other mode
when you listen to prerecord video it tend to take more time becaus i tend to be perfectionist
highest form of interact
it put less pressur on the student and allow them to complet their work at their own pace as they may not be as product in isol as they are normal
less awkward facetofac convers and can learn in your own time
the lesson are the same as when we use to have them in person
lockdown is lone and it give me a chanc to talk to a big group full of peopl i don’t usual talk to
i can go back and revisit ani materi i also can paus and resum if need
it is the closest you can get to real class at thi time if question aris you can just ask your professor no need to email them also it just feel good to know all of your friend are in the same lectur at the same time as you almost feel as if you are meet them
thing are easier to understand when explain by a teacher rather than read them
it’ easi
becaus dure live class you actual get to ask question and the teacher will most of the time answer your question right away secondli i feel like with live class you actual get a littl bit of the interact with your teacherfellow student just like you would have in ‘normal’ school
it help me understand the subject better when i know the professor is in the moment with us explain i can also give feedback and add my opinion
short but help summari
i can speed up or slow down the video and i feel it’ more effici and easier
most similar to ab actual lesson
i find zoom class bore so watch them on doubl speed for time effici
live class are more engag and you are abl to ask question more easili
i feel heavili engag with the lectur via live class other method of onlin teach that are current avail such as record lectur and upload materi put a substanti amount of pressur on student to understand lectur materi with minim elabor as a result email lectur about the materi then becom time consum
zoom class honestli give me so much anxieti
make it fairer for everyon on the cours allow me to work through in my own time
better explain
interact
becaus when i do have call they’r gener quiet bore and i work well by myself
it’ more interact and we can get an answer to a question immedi rather than wait for a few hour for teacher to respond
i feel like so much time goe to wast when have live class i’m not alway comfort ask question either
becaus you can do it in your own time and can skip the bore bit
becaus it give me my space to watch the video do my own research about the topic listen care and sever time to the record and when i need to ask ani question i can contact my professor anytim
more interact
more interact with the teacher and easier to ask question and teacher can explain the question in more depth
teacher interact
libr class
it the one im more familiar with and that suit best my class as they were befor the pandem
it’ awkward sometim but you get a better understand of what you’r suppos to do — it’ a more activ mode of learn than the passiv of smhw task
it allow me to rewarch the video sever time and make note
more interact and closest resembl to real lesson
it is the most activ and interact mode
i like the interact with other and socialis
as it emul face to face lectur as close as possibl allow a two way commun between both instructor and student
it like a normal lesson in class
onli one we have
give the opportun for more detail explan from teacher similar to usual teach but give the option to work when you want to as oppos to live lesson peopl are struggl with mental health and sleep pattern the autonomi is necessari to be abl to actual function dure thi time
interact with tutor in real time
easier to understand materi
i can decid more freeli when to do which task
becaus it doesn’t feel as much of an effort as go through the upload materi and it is a motiv to get out of bed in the morn and make it easier to start the day
i prefer thi mode becaus i have the liberti to plan my day howev i wish but i can still see and hear the lesson be taught which make it easier for me to understand rather than just read lesson
becaus i can access the direct inform anytim i need to whilst revis
the teacher cant spend time on unnecessari stuff so they go strait to the point with that instead of have 4 hour class they wont spend more that 2 hour
easi to follow and allow for a deeper understand of subject materi
wont be affect by internet issu also mean i can access them at ani time live in a hous of 7 it difficult to get specif quiet time
you are abl to ask question and more like to focu becaus of how it is live time rather than pre record therefor feel more interact
i enjoy record lectur but the interact of live make it more interest on multipl level
it kind of depend on the type of subjectclass i’m have as a medic student a lot og our class are interact but for those that aren’t i prefer prerecord becaus it would allow me to go through at my own pace and when i have time a lot of us student work at the hospit now
learn the most abl to ask and explain question
can work on my own time schedul if i dont understand someth immedi i have time to look into it more by myself befor continu on with the work
becaus most of the time actual live meet are unnecessari and take up too much time instead with email i can plan my day how i want
i can rewind and revis what i’m be taught
activ engag and discuss
easier and more direct
i can directli ask question and have a convers and the fact that they are schedul at a specif time mean they are harder to ignor
you can watch more than onc or at your own pace to make the most of it
it allow us as student to feel like we a “back to normal” be with the teacher and it allow us to speak face to face with peopl from outsid our household
there’ more interact and it feel like an actual class
can actual interact and express my thought directli
you get to directli ask the teacher if you havent understood someth and they can rephras it or help you with figur it out
keep me account and allow me to structur my day well
i’m a veri independ learner i like learn at my own pace without someon just read the powerpoint to me sinc i can read it for myself
i feel uncomfort speak on live call
i’m less stress about have someon to question me about the topic and have more time to grasp all the inform
it mean that i can take the session in my own time when it suit me and at my own speed
is more dynam like to see professor and classmat
you can ask question to the professor and get respons in real time also it more interact
i can ask question to the teacher and interact dure lesson
i prefer be hand materi to work on myself rather than have to interact with other student with my camera and audio on when i am in a non academ set
becaus is similar to presenci class
i can ask question about thing i don’t understand stay focuss with minim interact for an hour is v hard when at home
we are abl to ask question and listen to how other are take the inform as well as how they are progress
more person and reassur that teacher are still there for us
anxieti over awkward of realtim video discuss
independ work done at home can be supplement with teacher actual speak through content and be abl to answer question as soon as you ask them similar to the structur of lesson in school
becaus it give me more freedom

at my highschool we have a decent amount of onlin googl meet and upload materi and assign in googl classroom i prefer record video becaus i can actual think about what the teacher is say and write my question down just like the normal class where i could ask the teacher immedi but when i am in a googl meet my laptop delay and is not work properli to type the question in the chat more student have thi problem what i do now is when i attend an onlin googl meet i record it on my phone i onli do thi with difficult subject or subject like histori where it is that what the teacher explain is veri import

becaus i love hear the materi from my teacher live
activ learn passiv learn when teacher simpli email resourc we are without guidanc and it’ much harder to concentr on our learn i find myself simpli read the materi and copi word for word the inform into booklet we are given to complet with the answer to the booklet onlin mean we can just copi them when teacher are present and we can activ discuss question and answer togeth eg via zoom similar to real physic lesson and it’ much easier to retain content and learn and it’ much more fun than copi answer from textbook
no other form of teach wa given

becaus when lectur are prerecord i can hit the paus button dure the lectur to write my note i think it is quit convini
easier to work through at my own pace
becaus we would be abl to gain valuabl knowledg on the subject that my lectur specialis in
i like to be abl to spela to discuss with my classmat or ask question to my professor i like to have set time when you have to go to class like you would have if you were on campu

better sens of the topic can paus feel as though prof tell you more
you can watch at ani time and don’t need to reli on wifi to connect to group call
it allow for futur refer as it is alway avail
i can easili focu on the lesson if we use live class and i can’t get distract
languag barrier is reduc and abl to move through content at your own pace
becaus you can ask question
zoom or live teach allow for realtim question to be ask if i don’t understand someth wherea record lectur mean that i can’t ask the lectur straight away and have to email afterward
would feel more engag and less distract
condens the inform
is gener more straightforward and concis i also find it less awkward and i have more freedom with timetablingplan my day rather than have to structur my work around video call
i can work at my own pace
i can freeli choos when to do my uniwork and am more flexibl concern my daili schedul video are more engag and live than textmateri
i prefer have live class becaus it forc me to still be product and not get behind it kept me motiv

i prefer be abl to talk to them face to face for help and learn so i can understand more
can type the question for your lectur to answer live i feel much more comfort do that than rais my hand in a lectur and becaus i can ask question i can get the most out of my learn
becaus it is interact
becaus it is almost like the class we are all use to but onlin it allow us to stop the professor ask them to go slowerfast or ani question we might have on the topic of learn
you can ask question right away
more interact can ask specif question
becau i cannot postpon the lesson with record lectur i have a tendenc to procrastin and not listen to it
i can listen to them at my own pace and i dont have mani seminarsclass anyway in my degre so live class and forum arent necessari
most inform and time effect can revisit
i can do it at my own pace
easi to follow along at your own pace and make it easi to studi whenev you have a free moment no fix time to log on
becaus i can speed up the video if i need to or rewind if i miss someth
live call retain the engag with your teacher and peer and allow you to feel more involv in activ learn togeth
more opportun to engag
keep me engag
i like the interact sometim we are put into smaller group which make it feel more person and you can catch up with peopl you don‘t talk to except for in class
i am abl to do it in my own time wherea i had to make sure i wa free for the seminar
easier and not as bore
you can go back and revis whenev you need to
you habe a schedul you can virtual see the other one and it‘ interact
especi with smaller class thi mode is the most engag and i come away more satisfi with my understand of the materi
feel more social and interact
interact is given
it’ the most interact
i feel like i can’t connect properli with peopl on a screen it’ too passiv like i’m watch a film
feel more like a regular face to face class more social better chanc of understand
as it forc you to watch the lectur and be activ in the class
better interact with all of my professor
i find i am usual abl to grasp the materi quit rapidli and come to a good understand without much teacher intervent but as thi method is supplement by some record video and live class i find i cover the content veri well
make me more motiv
i like have the engag factor of watch someon talk through a topic but also the secur and comfort of be abl to watch it over until i understand it though thi can make me focu less if i feel less pressur in the moment
my studi reli on help each other and teamwork a lot and i felt like i couldn’t do all my assign all alon
i like to commun with other
becaus it feel closest to actual be in class
you can paus it or watch it whenev fit you best
becaus it keep me account
i can alway playback the video if i dont understand the content
it’ more interact
lot of peopl in my cours just use the record lectur instead of go to lectur anyway they were be record even befor the pandem
it allow for less wast time and i’m never engag on zoom class email work is straightforward and i can do it and move on
becaus then you are abl to ask question dure the class with a quick respons and abl to discuss to complet understand the topic
video can demonst the practic element of my cours but also you can do it at your own leisur
it offer more interact and allow to ask more question
it is easi to engag and ask question when i am curiou about someth or if i am struggl
it’ an engag and less formal mean in which discuss flow
it encourag convers and interact between the professor and the student it’ more product
i can go at my own pace and it is also accommod for student that are now in differ time zone
immedi respons from teacher face to face interact verbal explan of workmor difficult area of the topic
similar to face to face learn you can ask your teacher question and they can aid you instead of have to cope with the work yourself
more interact
i can paus them so i can take note better than if do it live also i can access it at ani time so no 9am
the teacher can elabor on their slideshow materi and i can ask question when i have them which is super import for my learn i have brain damag from an ill so i struggl with memori and process and ask question while i’m learn help me a lot
when do inlin class you can bring up question gather feed back or even elabor on concept i also prefer independ learn and email work for me to do at my own rate
it’ more engag and stop me from get distract
not live do not have to film yourself
more structur
the interact make it feel as ‘normal’ as possibl
i can watch it whenev i like when i know there will be no distract be abl to paus and rewind if i don’t understand it there is also less pressur than be live
im a visual learner unlik to print out materi write further note and mind map compar to listen to inform
connect with teacher
most similar to normal uni
it remain anonym it make me anxiou be in video call or talk on platform especi when there are potenti lot of peoplepeopl i dont realli know
flexibl fit my own schedul
can work at my own pace without miss inform and easili access
much easier to ask specif question and get feedback
it’ concis and clear zoom is fun but can be scari and time can be wast
i can work whenev suit me rather than at a certain time
becaus we can commun better
less stress on my poor internet connect and i can revisit it
i can ask the teacher ani doubt i have dure the lesson
my school don’t offer onlin class
it’ more person and convers
becaus i can choos to complet it at ani time befor the deadlin so i can organ my daili activ and dont have to show up for class at a specif hour
in live class it is easier to ask the teacher all the question when the inform is still fresh and it is easier to engag it help to know that the teacher is there at the moment and is guid you through the step
easier to get involv in discuss
becaus it’ the closest to the typic class set you get in colleg
explan from the teacher not just the materi
record lectur can be upload in small chunk which make learn easier at home
onlin video class hold me account for my schoolwork i actual have to work at the set class time and if i don’t understand the content discuss in the call i’m more inclin to go back and studi what i’m behind on readi for the next call
to me it the closest it can get to a normal lectur not onlin becaus you still have a set time to follow the live lectur
it feel more interact
to allow flexibl across time zone
i can watch it on my own time and paus when i need to for note
as the lectur can answer ani question quickli and effici you have dure that time
becaus you can still feel like you’r in a normal day schedul
becaus i have to watch it at a certain i‘m not disciplin enough for record lectur
it feel like i’m in the classroom in real life but i can paus it to take note and watch it whenev i want zoom call would be too invas
easier to catch up on can read back through and dont have to make note
there is better commun
whilst have a detail email sent to us for each lesson which cover the necessari content well the absenc of debat and the opportun to particip in live discuss is also as insight to the cours so a from of immedi class discuss wouldv been realli benefici
zoom call go on too long and i’d prefer get on with it alon
i can watch record lectur in my own time and rewatch them if necessari
you can just get on with the work
more interact
it wa easi to manag in your own time and good for look back on topic
no pressur or awkward of be on an onlin call but still get the benefit of have work explain i am also a visual learner
becaus i can interact with other student
it hold me account i don’t think i would have the motiv to teach myself the content if i had to watch the video by myself thi also allow for the highest level of engag and convers which is crucial at the graduat level
becaus narrat of powerpoint are more use than me tri to teach myself also there’ the chanc to ask question on content i don’t understand
it is the closest to the real tradit live teach
don’t need to directli interact with everyon which stress me
it wa the onli method utilis by my colleg so i have no knowledg of other medium
not have to talk to peopl can get away with do work in my pyjama
it give me the most opportun to write lectur note i can paus the record to jot down what is on the powerpoint and then resum to add in what the lectur say
i like be abl to go over the content
can watch it whenev
it nice to have some sort of structur dure the week that asynchron model of teach cannot provid
there are no time restraint i could work on it when i’d like to
it’ better to have a specif time assign to watch a certain lectur rather than it be record and upload becaus it requir more energi to actual sit down and watch those later
it’ interact
it get the work across effici and effect
interact can ask question if need
more interact and more engag
activ but doe not reli as much no your resourc eg with a bad internet conect attend to live class is not alway possibl
you are abl to easili ask question and it feel more interact wherea i feel less motiv to learn the materi if they are just in a record video or worksheet
feel like im there
it’ more interact and doesn’t give me pressur to ask for help when they have explain everyth in detail previous
it’ much more activ learn you can realli get to grip with the materi and test your learn by ask and answer question
endgam to with your tutor and peer
you can learn at your own requir time and can repeat the record data as much al you want to
becaus it give me a similar standard of learn to if i wa sat in a lectur hall facetofac with my lectur
covid ha made mani peopl live a bit chaotic and our homeworkstudi circumst have chang as have our person schedul therefor i like be abl to watch the lectur when i pleas so im not stuck if i miss them i can then supplement thi with the class note were given and our lectur hold webinar occasion to answer question that way befor examsdeadlin to help us they are also veri respons to email so i feel well support
explain thing that i wouldnt understand probabl in a textbook
more interactionengag
becaus i can work without help and individu
teacher interact and explan if you don’t understand you can ask
you can share idea with each other and you don’t feel so alon when you don’t understand part of the cours
becaus you can work through the materi at your own pace and have the opportun to do other work if you finish earli howev i do like to have onlin call as well as it help with explan
in the moment ask question love
it is the closest way to replic oncampu learn
i can correspond eith the teacher quickli
becaus i like the engag in live class at the same time i also like the paus button in record class
it’ more interact and engag
it is more engag and it’ much easier to ask question and ask for help when necessari
i can paus and replay thing i dont understand and do it accord to my schedul
it’ the closest to a lesson
live class are closest to inperson class and are the most engag i like need to be alert
have subject content explain to you like in a lesson is so much easier and engag then be given the text book page to learn and exam question which is what i’m receiv now
i prefer to work independ
becaus you still get the interact of face to face make the learn more human
get to add content myself ask question contact with friend from uni
thi is the most interact mode of teach and most close resembl the inperson lecturestutori i had befor class were shift onlin
it most engang and easier to focu and ha at least a littl bit of the social aspect that now miss but it work best for seminarsdiscuss groupsexercis classeslanguag class etc not so much for actual lectur for lectur prerecord are best as you can watch them in your own speed and there wouldnt usual be discuss anyway
it feel almost as interact as a normal class
i am free to manag my time
real time clarif on question and the closest thing to real class as possibl
it is more interact and give us space to ask question
can learn at own pace and speed
more interact and i make you attend and learn
as i can paus the lectur and therefor learn the content at my own pace
it provid some form of “face to face” contact which help keep me focus
whith record your teacher is abl to think a while about what they are explain and edit their video and i fele like that give it a bretter qualiti also you can go back and watch it again later if you need
feel like actual colleg
i can watch ani time i want and as mani time i want
record lectur are much better for understand i can adjust speed and rewatch but activ should be implement like littl quizz
motiv me to do it at that time instead of catch it up later as it’ live as there can be a discuss alongsid it
it allow me to engag more with the key theme and idea present within the class
i feel like i understand it easili
i enjoy face to face interact
record lectur and upload materi are my prefer mode becaus they are more engag for me as a student with adhd innatent type becaus i can paus it rewind rewatch or skip ahead if i need to for understand i can also do thi work whenev in the day and i don’t have to tri and work in a time i can’t focu in or deal with the distract of other and lag that zoom ha
more interact and can easili talk to teacher instead of have to wait for a repli to an email which could take a while
freedom of schedul
work at own pace and can still be taught i feel like with set materi especi biolog i’m just rewrit what had been set and not proactiv learn
interact
broadband problem make live class difficult to follow
can be follow at my own pace and is less stress then onlin live class bc i don’t have a great environ to be focu all the time
more account to engag with content
easier to ask question and instant respons
allow for more interact
interact
allow for interact lesson
becaus i can alway refer to it later in day also all of my live class are set at veri inconveni time and i’m not alway keen to assist to the class
allow student to do person studi on the content beforehand gain some background knowledg then appli thi knowledg to complex question dure a discuss allow for faster and more in depth learn than just rote memoris
while most of my lectur are pre record from other year there are a few which are be record through zoom and they’r address straight to us with question relat to the materi pop up at certain time as a first year biom student have question which we can answer for subject such as chem and physic realli help with understand
it make it easier to ask question
it allow me to work on it when i have time as despit class be cancel i found i had even more work than normal
i’m more motiv and there are less distract
allow me to studi in my own time without ad pressur of be in a classroom
when it’ live i actual attend when it’ a record lectur i procrastin watch
i am abl to have the task explain in depth and detail as well as in differ form to fulli understand it
it’ the closest to normal lectur at univers
can do whenev
you can work through the content at your own pace and just ask question when you need to
it allow for the nearest experi to actual be in a classroom we can have discuss and interact with the teacher
less pressur to do thing in a limit amount of time also more time to do extra research on thing
i can do it in my own time
engag with lectur feel guilti if i don’t concentr
i think that live lesson would be more engag and it easier to ask question and pay attent rather than teach yourself the inform and perhap not fulli understand or teach yourself aspect wrong
it give a clearer understand as it isn’t just read off a powerpoint but actual be explain
as a work student it give me the opportun to studi in differ session you can go back or skip a part of the video if you need it
it’ similar to what i’d have at colleg and is more reliabl than live class due to wifi issu peopl have
interact with other help me retain the inform better
becaus you get to understand better and u are less like to procrastin studi and leav it for anoth time
can ask question and get a more in depth explan
i can ask the teacher question live
i can grow a greater understand for my subject by hear other peopl thought
make me keep a work schedul
i can take my time understand the concept and take note
get to engag with the lectur and peer
more interact and most similar to real life school
becaus i can work at my own pace and structur my time how i like
the option to paus the class and go back to thing which aid my learn it also mean i can take class at conveni time
you can listen to them whenev you want
help me understand the materi it feel like you are part of a group that is go through the same thing instead of feel alon without interact
it’ easier to keep up to date if they’r live not sure whi but it work and it also add a bit more structur to my day which i like
it feel the most like a ‘normal’ lectur opportun to ask question and see your class member and staff
it veri similar to the real classroom
more flexibl to do the work at time that suit me
i am abl to work at a faster pace than i would in real time class and be more effici with my time
work becom too much without a set timet that come with live lesson
it allow interact with lectur
can catch up at own pace no pressur to be avail at a certain time
becaus it feel like i’m actual be engag with like a real lesson
you can work at your own pace and play thing back if you didnt understand thing properli usual these record lectur are pair with a live class when the lectur would usual be that is use for question sinc you then dont hear about the materi for the first time you can understand all the question and answer a lot better you are also abl to work whenev you want and whenev it fit your schedul
i feel like it the easiest to overcom and keep forcus on
i can plan my own time
possibl of ask question and interact
onlin live class are much harder to sit through for me becaus of all the nois and weird video interact it obvious not the same as a live class it feel more like watch a movi and interact with it it wa kind of exaust if i have to listen to a prerecord lectur i dont have to interact with anyon and i can do it in my own time so that i dont have to sit in front of the camera for five hour straight and i still can ask question via email or someth like that so i feel like thi isnt less effici but more comfort
becaus if it’ happen live you feel more involv and engag
minim contact and can do in my own timefram
i actual pay attent
more interact and you can alway ask for help immedi see my classmates’ face
it keep me engag and account more than the other mode if it were all selfguid learn i would struggl to stay on track
as it is closest to a normal lectur and allow real time question to be ask
easier to learn
so the teacher can talk through the content i find it easier to learn thi way
more like to want to do the work and it feel the most like a classroom set
it often seem more dynam and person just as in person class use to be befor covid19
it is so much more help to have someon explain concept than to simpli read textbook page
becaus i am more abl to write down what the teacher say by paus and revers the video and still pay attent to what be said without be too foucues on write fast
instant question and answer
give us a chanc to be discuss answer and queri with the teacher whilst have some form of verbal commun
becaus it make it easier to have a routin
you can keep return to it it’ like film a class
have if live class resembl my in person experi the most for class with prerecord lectur it felt like i wa in a prolong final period do work but class did not feel in session i engag more in live class and felt more account for my work sinc i wa meet multipl time a week and engag with the professor and other student
easier to tick off the work that need to be complet
the abil to paus and complet task dure the lectur as well as take note and watch to gain better understand make it easier to get to grip with each topic
more like to engag with content and prof could use more engag qa format onli have 3 hour a week on zoom but more would be help
i feel as if i can work at my own pace
feel more motiv
interact with tutor is absolut critic at degre level
i feel as if you can engag and discuss more directli with your tutor so it’ more of a structur lesson
the teacher get confus on zoom and everyon play around with background and stuff email the work just mean i can submit it and have done
can watch them whenev and understand the content at your own pace
onlin uni feel v imperson and my anxieti find video discuss horrif
can do it when you want at your own pace
can ask question and get an answer straight away like in a school set
it feel more like a classroom set more person
i think that our zoom class are not effici becaus the teacher just read the handout and it doesn’t bring anyth more so i prefer to work in my own at my own pace watch a yt vid if necessari
i get to see my classmat and lectur help me feel less alon and give me some sens of routin amidst the crisi
i can watch the video ani time i want chang the playback speed and focu better
i feel like it easier to understand as you can paus a video when you like or repeat it without disturb anyon els plu usual better video qualiti
becaus you get to actual see who is take the class and interact with them
can paus it rewind etc
allow for better flow of question and answer more fluent and realist way of learn howev it’ not time flexible— ie peopl from other time zone don’t get the benefit
it allow us to paus and rewind give us a better chancemor time to understand the topic befor befor move on prevent us from get lost due to the lectur move too quickli it easier to watch and listen than to just read it make lockdown feel less lone
you can watch it whenev suit paus it if u need rewatch etc and then email question after if u need
i can rewatch it when i dont understand a particular thing or i am a littl bit behind
you can watch rematch the record lectur whenev it’ more conveni
it resembl face to face class the most
much more engag and interact way better way to learn than self teach through provid resourc
i can ask question
i haven’t actual done a zoom class befor but i feel like i would benefit from it more becaus i find it hard to learn from just read materi
allow me to skip and paus and understand concept easier rather than tri to catch up dure a live call
becaus you can speed up or down the speed of your cours but upload materi and onlin class are great too a mix is the best
it’ closest to in person experi
more engag and hold me account to actual do the work
can take it in your own time
it is easi to catch up on anyth that ha been miss you can stop and start them whenev you pleas
becaus it allow me to work in my own pace with the materi and it remov the pressur of have to go to lectur
abl to commun instantli and have question answer there and then if there are ani concept and not have to wait for respons via email which can wast valuabl time
we don’t actual have to do it no exam
becaus it is the most similar model to an actual class
get to see and hear other peopl
onlin class are bore and a wast of time
interact just like a seminar
caus you can watch it over and over again if you don’t understand the content
more interact and easier to engag with content
for the access to ask question in the moment and clarifi doubt from the past lectur
becaus i can access the class in my own time at my own pace
it enabl me to ask question and commun with my teacher class and give more structur for do my school work it also allow the teacher to go over content straight away if anyon is confus
it feel most like actual class
it is interact and actual effect experi is veri close to face to face class
it is more interact than email materi someon is explain it you to which is engag and you can paus it when need
it mean everyon can commun at whatev time suit them best i prefer to do school at night as i work dure the day in a supermarket right now so it help with flexibl mean i can continu be a key worker
it motiv me the most and feel the most normal if it just record or upload then it feel like i lose structur to my day and i becom lazi becaus i say to myself oh it okay i can do it anoth time i dont need to work today or it fine if i lie in bed until 12 and go to bed at 1 in the morn
it feel more connectedperson
becaus it’ easier to discuss and share idea live
abl the ask question
can work through materi at your own pace
simul a classroom but i can do it anywher
becaus i can review and go back on part i don’t understand and take as much time as i need
can go back and listen to them when neededif stuck lectur dont record the zoom class
record lectur we also have discuss forum as well which are amaz becaus our instructor can answer ani question we have about the cours materi assign question which is realli handi as all my immunolog lab are now onlin
becaus it’ interact and question can be answer
easier to complet on your own schedul and can take your time to understand the materi
can look at lectur board but also listen to lectur also feel normal compar to upload powerpoint
more face time
i get to follow my own rhythm
abl to ask question
i think i would gain more out of thi i struggl with just be given paper and understand what to do i learn better when there are peopl explain it to me
it is nice to hear differ peopl opinion and learn from their knowledg
interact
i can do the work in my own time
i feel more engag when it’ live
more like real class more interact can ask question give you more of a routin rather than watch in one go
becaus you can engag with the teacher by ask question and get clarif about stuff if you don’t understand someth also most like the normal school day
i can concentr easili
im more motiv to particip as i have a set class at a set time i can prepar for extern motiv is realli help for me also be abl to ask question rather than attenpt to condens them into an email make correct mistakesfind out more so much easier
you can work by your own timet
then i can decid myself when i’m gonna take the lesson and you can paus them
becaus zoom clasd are more similar to what i wa use to
becaus you can ask the lectur question and it help make seminar more interact
record lectur are easier and more conveni to access live class do help you maintain disciplin and complet cours materi on time howev due to wifi or load shed we are unabl to connect to live lectur if i miss a part of the lectur then im unabl to grasp the whole topic idk if it relev but im an account and financ major also our professor arent realli train to conduct onlin class so the lectur arent interact and we lose focu so there realli isnt much differ between a record and live lectur at least we can paus record lectur and understand the topic in detail through the read materi
there is more explan and help
lesson in real time mean that is closest to a normal classroom set allow for class discuss
give me time to do it at my own pace and i can explor thing deeper that i would perhap otherwis
allow interact with the teacher and other classmat which improv understand
onlin lectur are hard to focu on and stress to attend i’d rather just be told what need to get done and do it on my own
i can paus and replay when i need clarif
all of the thing are explain veri well and they come in 2030 minut video so it’ not hard to pay attent and they can even be fun and interest
the time is set you have less of a chanc to end up do your work later than it should be done also interact is better with question which can be ask and you can particip in the lesson and use the class feedback
becaus the student are abl to interact with the teacher to some extent far more so than passiv learn from lectur
becaus it enabl you to ask question and for your teacher to explain content person
freedom to do it whenev you like
i like to be abl to interact with tutor ask question and encourag discuss
allow me to hear a live explan of the inform my teacher voic and elabor and help me to encod it better into my memori than mindlessli copi a powerpoint or do practic problem
live class allow for discuss and keep you account for your effort they also allow for peopl to ask question and get immedi respons addit a professor can gaug understand and engag in real time to ensur we are gain the most out of teach
i realli like the fact that as it’ live it’ a much more engag atmospher and as someon who’ not afraid to ask question i can interject and ask for clarif or further explan while other can also join in and you just get bonu knowledg out of it which is great
in a live class you can talk and collabor with peer and your teacher while you are do the work also make it a lot less bore and it’ nice to be abl to talk to peopl when you’r just sit home alon
i would prefer the flexibl to teach myself as and when plu onlin lectur mean that if you have a lectur who isn’t veri skill it lead to sever hour of wast time tri to listen and learn from them
easier to go over in my own time and work at my own pace
i could choos when i got to view the materi rather than have a schedul zoom call i wa requir to attend choos my school schedul wa nice
email materi
so i can talk to everyon and and work out problem as i attempt them
becaus if you don’t understand someth you can just rewatch paus when need take proper note
easier to go through the cours at your own pace
usual more structur so easier to make note from visual are clearer and then can email question rais through zoom
easier to go at own speed
easier
easi to do in your own time at your own pace within your own schedul
easier to ask question
thing be live give it a bit of interact the fact that your oblig to particip in that activ at a given time make sure you dont procrastin
i can paus as mani time as i like and take break etc also i hate talk 😂
it put a lot less pressur on peopl if they forget about an onlin class or have to miss out for ani other reason and thi way they can have perman access to class when they studi
you’r get live feedbackinst respons
becaus it allow to express your opinion and discuss with other
most similar to how it wa previous and is the most engag
more engag
actual live human connect is awesom in these time also zoom ha a lot of great featur to enhanc the learn like screen share etc
to be abl to go back and watch the explan
abl to ask question right away more structur week with record lectur i tend to procrastin and watch them all at the last minut thi wouldnt be possibl with live class
becaus it is easier to commun with the professor as you can ask them the thing you dont understand at the time they are explain it and also interact with them and your classmat
it make it so much easier to be activ engag in class especi if the group is smaller i feel more confid ask more question therefor i feel like i am take away much more from these meet than at school
it’ easier to organis help me learn activ
becaus it’ easi access
i think thi depend on who your prof is and what class you are in i like that there is less possibl for miscommun in written instruct and materi
i can ask my teacher question and get them to explain concept in more detail a lot easier and quicker than send an email then wait for a repli
it more interact and feel more like a real lectur becaus you can ask question in real time
activ engag in the class abl to give live feedback and ask question to lecturerstutor and other student
becaus it depend on the live interact and if i couldnt understand someth the lectur could repeat it again in anoth way and it mimic the actual real cours to some extent
i prefer to work on my own
it more straight forward and interact also easier to commun
we have teacher for a reason and live teach allow me access to them they can explain and break down concept for me when i need them to
flexibl which is handi for the current situat
i don’t have to wake up earli
becaus then i would have a motiv to interact with that class better if all of the student would have to join
becaus it feel more like a real class that you can engag in and have to attend at certain time it’ the closest you can get to the normal we all current crave
i get to interact and feel like i’m part of someth which make me more motiv and interest
i think conexion with tutor is more person and i find that engag
easier to interact and vocalis hear other thought
becaus you still get to interact with the teacher and have a discuss of sort with the class
i feel like it’ easier to engag as it’ all written out and it’ fun to engag through type some time it’ bore listen to a teacher go on and on and not let ani student realli talk chat mode make it feel more access and easi to commun and you don’t have to worri about sound dumb as you can type it up and edit befor post
get to interact with peopl
you have to join in and it’ mroe interact and interest
still have some connect with the teacher but can be done at ani time to suit your own schedul
easier to commun with teacher and share idea
much easier to ask question sens of interact
mainli becaus my cours is art base fashion and textil student and it wouldn’t be practic if we were on a zoom call etc
can review at own pace
becaus i can watch it multipl time and i can paus whenev i want to make note etc
as you can go back to the inform but it is also use to have microsoft team meet so that seminar can still happen
it’ more interact and is far better as the teacher are actual explain content as they would be in school
it is easi to contact teacher instantli
thi way would be like as if i would be attend the lectur at uni
becaus that way i fell like im the most product i can do my assign whenev i want i like the freedom aspect of it
face to face interact allow more open convers
it’ help as it’ easier to gain inform from it is compil into one area and it remind me of be in the classroom
less work lol
it’ all i have know n would like explor
i prefer the flexibl record lectur give me also give the facil of be abl to paus rewind and take good note as i go the live lectur aren’t alway record
it creat a schedul for you and ensur that you don’t fall behind if you can choos when to listen to lectur i think there’ a risk of leav it all to the last minut howev live lectur that are also record and then post in case you need them are my favourit
becaus i can make my own schedul paus the video and watch it sever time
allow activ learn and abil to ask question with time answer
i find live video class overwhelm and would rather be abl to engag with live present lectur at my own pace without the pressur of video chat
dont have anyth els atm
there is a lot more interact with the teacher a lot more one on one convers like recreat a classroom environ
i can go back over what i miss when write note by paus or rewind so i can do it studi in my own time
onlin class for more clarif
i can ask question in real time via the chat function andor ask ani follow up question we can bounc question off of each other as a class to get a better understand of the content i also feel much more of a sens of connect with my classmat and teacher
it‘ far more commun easier to follow along and it give you the feel of actual be there with your friend also a set time help to add structur to the day
allow a class interact and collabor experi
more interact and engag
forc me to engag anyth otherwis and i would struggl to structur my work
more contact with teacher opportun to ask question and discuss thing properli also opportun to chat briefli to friend
allow for flexibl plu download a pdf is easier on the internet than zoom which i often find to be patchi or unstabl due to internet use
the interact is necessari for aural learner and to ask ani question the facial express make it feel like real life a bit more comfort in these unsettl time
give us a chanc to interact with our tutor and peer better than onlin record
i prefer work on someth record as you can stop it rewind it and take note whenev you want
it’ easier to interact with both peer and teacher and easier to pay attent
abl to rewatch and paus at your own speed
it’ much more engag as you care abl to learn from the lectur a lot more
it still feel like a real lectur you can answer question in real time and don’t have to bother wait for an email repli
in zoom meet not mani peopl talk i am a first year and we onli got 1 day of face to face befor onlin so everyon is a bit anxiou to collabor i think so i gener learn more from record lectur
i like be abl to paus and go back to recov thing i miss
less isol abl to have discuss and get live feedback and ask question feel more like a typic tutori at univers
when teacher do video they can actual explain everyth thoroughli
becaus i can watch the lectur again as much as i want and it help me memeor everyth even though i couldnt realli choos the option i do think web seminar are so import to have alongsid of these as the convers we have about the content of the lectur help increas the level of understand
it feel the most like a normal class especi when it wa replac what should have been a seminar as it allow for discuss and feedback from lectur and student and wa more collabor then listen to a prerecord i also like the human aspect of it see other peopl face and hear their voic instead of just a type messag
i can go back and relisten to what my prof ha said
i just think thi is the easiest way for primari teach and then thi is supplement by set question or exercis and then if there are ani specif question you can just email lectur and ask for help
possibl interact
can choos when to watch as oppos to have to rememb it’ happen at a certain time
live lectur feel closest to the experi i have in the classroom
it is almost like be with the teacher you can still contribut to the discuss and ask question
it is help to be abl to ask teacher question like they are in person with you
there is more of a chanc to have discuss with both peer and lectur and more in depth knowledg gain from talk about the materi
concis deliveri of inform
it’ conduc to engag and creat a better environ to ask and answer question know you can get instant feedback and be more convos
it allow for more commun between the student and teacher
i find it much easier to process and understand the inform and concept when i don’t have to read it
i am abl to interact with my teacher there and then and ask question whilst we are go through content
maintain a schedul and routin to the day wherea other method resembl homework assign instead
becaus it is the most similar to class time discuss
it’ way easier in order to organis my work through the entir week
becaus you can ask question there and then to your teacher
live class aren’t conduct well
well thi maintain the privaci of one and doe it job of convey inform pretti good
becaus you can still have some form of live interact with other student and the lectur
less lag and more product use of time
interact keep me attent span social aspect of see face rather than watch video of record lectur
becaus it provid motiv that is record lectur and email work load requir you to exercis greater amount of dilig also onlin class are the closest thing to normal class and thu provid a sens of normalci they also allow you to listen to real time discuss
i am current write my thesi so it nice to be in a call and get immedi feedback and help
allow me to go at my own pace
becaus i still feel as like i’m have a classroom experi i still get to talk with my teacher and friend who i haven’t been abl to see and it add a sens of normal back to my life it also great to be abl to ask question and get i stand respons
there is an opportun for clarif and explan
you get to see and have discuss with your teacher and classmat the way we were given our work wa not veri interact and quit isol as we were unabl to see our teacher and classmat in an onlin chat
cant procrastin as much easier to ask question as ssnding email feel awkward and less fluid
more interact
i can paus at ani time necessari record lectur but i have the advantag of “live question time” in which question about the lectur which i have now thoroughli watch can be ask essenti i have “the best of both worlds”
it’ faster to get a respons to a specif question
i don’t feel motiv when all i get it email i like actual have a class and see my teacher
becaus you can ask question get an instant answer which you don’t get on email
becaus if someth happen while i should be in class i can see it later and not loos anyth
becaus it the most similar to actual class and it make it easi to expos doubt and discuss the materi not onli with the teacher but with the rest of the class too
watch whenev
it allow you to engag activ with the content by ask the instructor in real time about your doubt make it as similar as possibl to facetofac lesson
becaus it feel the closest to an real class and becaus it live you can ask the teacher and get answer right away
interact
i can go back to them anytim and rewind if i need to
give you chanc to watch over if you did not understand someth also live lesson are chaotic due to connect problem and the misus of it
freedom and flexibl to work when you want to work
becaus lot of inform can be discuss from mani differ perspect and angel some of which have never cross my mind in addit i get to ask question
more interact abl to ask question
most similar to a classroom set
it is veri similar to be in a lectur theatr the zoom tutori are clunki and hard to get particip from student
more interact
it wa more interact it wa nice to see familiar classmat face and help my mental health see everyon for a littl while i also felt more engag as teacher would ask question to student individu so it help me concentr more and kept me on the ball
more social
can watch them whenev i want at my own free will
it’ similar to what in person lectur were like
i can hear watch the record lectur anytim and rewind the bit ive miss becaus my attent span is short
get to ask question in real time with the lectur present rather than email them
it allow me to go back and listen
make you motiv to do it
i can do it on my own time when it work for me if professor post them ahead of time it allow me to get ahead
i hate listen i find i’m more a visual learner tend to get distract realli easili is i’m sit their listen at home
student are abl to ask question in real time and get immedi respons thu aid in engag
keep you engag and make you do the work and ask question and add some fun to what could be veri dull
easier to focu
learn at my own pace
my classmat are from all around the world sinc i go to an intern high school uwc in mostar and see all my friend regularli in class is realli nice and creat a sens of normal despit be so far away from each other also for complex and discuss base class inperson call are use for ask question
you can slow the lectur down when you are have a hard time understand someth but you can also speed it up if you alreadi have a good understand of the topic
it allow for more flexibl student schedul
most authent chat with peopl etc
i can learn at my own pace
allow you to studi the materi beforedo practis question and ask question on thing you don’t understand if the group is larg thi is less use as you are more like to end up watch answer to other question you understand yourself without get a chanc to ask your own
discuss topic with other is the most effect way to find out if you actual understood everyth
there more fix time involv which help hold me account and give me a more fix schedul i also enjoy small group teach over live class as there potenti for discuss and share idea to work out a problem i do math so thi is often realli use
interact but casual at the same time
it feel more interact as i would be abl to ask question plu it would be more motiv know there a live lectur rather than upload record one
can control the speed of tutor abl paus and rewind
i actual feel engag when on a call with my peer and i know i’m up to speed with everyon els
don’t have to interact with anyon yet teacher are abl to commun materi better
the live interact be abl to see face and ask question then and there instead of have to email them
although the zoom class were kind of fun and interact howev i think have prerecord lectur for student and then a zoom class after where student shouldv been given an assign to insur that they have watch the lectur wouldv been a lot more effect at least for me given that i am the type of learner that need thing to be repeat more than onc so i can fulli understand and work well with the materi i am given
i havent experienc the other mode
you can repeat the part of the lectur again if you didn‘t understand it complet and as well take some break if you want to but most importantli the professor will mayb give you some badli need inform or explan that you won‘t get that easili otherwis
live class mode 1
it forc particip and there can be no passiv learn in lesson it mean we remain focuss and alert in lesson rather than get distract or procrastin do set assign from email
it’ basic the same as an in person class except there are no distract also you can watchcomplet the lectur on your own time
keep me account the schedul mean i have to stay on top of thing l
easier commun structur
freedom in structur my day
the most contact between student and teacher and easi possibl
becaus it’ basic just like normal class and you can ask question and get them answer right away
it give you more flexibl to get the assign complet at ani point of the week
i realli miss the class discuss and thi mode is the one that is more close to the presenci experi
panic if i had to interact with other
it simul some sort of human interact
just easier to get on with do the work
becaus i like do thing at my own pace
with zoom there is no oblig to contribut as you can just have both your microphon and video turn off whilst with post there is usual a deadlin which mean peopl have to respond in order to get a mark so thi mean there is much more of a discuss go on through type and not speak
becaus u can basic make your own plan which is how i like to work i dont like it when i have to follow other plan i just feel less motiv
more interact with the lectur tutor
it allow the materi to be revisit more easili and allow more freedom of when i do the work
much more interact could ask question as you thought of them
keep student account
it’ the best way which i understand and can easili ask question to my teacher
i can easili go back to it when i need to
more engag
help to ask question and get immedi respons while the materi is still fresh in your mind rather than wait 12 busi day for a repli
record live class or audio record on lectur slide as you can go back and listen if your struggl to focu
help me focu and engag with the content more effect
more interact feel like normal
as i am larg studi human and literatur verbal explan and discuss is central to my understand
it is more interact and if i’m stuck i can get an answer immedi rather than wait for the teacher to repli back which could take age
to abl to get other people’ feedback and easier to be heard the knowledg of modul and it is explain better
you can paus the record and watch it as mani time as you want
becaus it’ happen in real time so it’ harder to procrastin and not do it
you can go back on someth and repeat it as often as you like
allow better engag and creat a more posit work atmospher make everyon still feel connect and allow more time with tutor
can paus and take note repeat section
it just simpl and easi go and i have alway prefer lesson where we discuss
becaus it allow direct interact with the teacher instead of learn by yourself i don’t feel like i can fulli engag in work when i can’t easili and directli ask question about it
abil to respond immedi and better flow convers compar to just messag
i learn more
microsoft team
can work at my own paceconveni
more engag and easier to commun and allow you to plan a schedul
it’ the closest replac to face to face teach
i like be abl to do thing at my own pace
more interact i feel that the effort i am make is reciproc
i get to interact with my supervisor like normal meet the way they use to be
it’ much more engag i’d prefer if lectur were live too
becaus you can watch it whenev you want and as mani time as you want
it make me account and ensur i put asid enough time to realli understand the content
becaus i don’t have to speak awkwardli to teacher
abl to ask teacher question real time learn more from face to face
i like to have 2 hour of just explain all the content and have the abil to chang the speed paus or go back and basic learn at my own pace
i work and understand more when the teacher is in front of me and keep me motiv to understand the materi
it give me the chanc to learn at my own pace and rewatch the lectur whenev i need to
work can be explain well and lot of materi can be upload for use
abl to ask question and interact
can pausedo when it suit you
i wa abl to learn on my own time i didnt have to be on camera but it still felt like they were teach me when we upload work it felt like i wasnt learn
it’ better than thing like zoom becaus i can go back and watch
face to fave
teacher are abl to explain the content in more detail than what a textbook or other materi is capabl of
can go back and replay bit if miss and can listenwatch lectur whenev i want
get to see someon in person and their voic is usual way more interest
can interact with fellow classmat and teacher
becaus i can repeatedli listen and learn without the time limit
i feel less alon when i can actual see my peer also studi and work from home
becaus it enabl me to handl work on my own time and prioritis accord to my need
we don’t get the opportun to use thi method but i would prefer it as it would be more interact and engag would also provid more motiv to watch as it’ easier to just skip through a record piec
becaus im free to work at my own pace sometim an hour lesson onli need 10min sometim 2hour
can give the full content without worri about a time limit
we get all the same inform as we would in a class and we can still speak to our teacher and classmat about the lesson occur
interact is the best way for me to learn
can ask question have discuss beyond or around the lectur content and you can actual see peopl
i can ask question
it allow me to work at my own pace i can ask my professor question via email if i need help
can ask question there and then and don’t have to wait for a repli have a littlesimpl question which can normal be done in lecturesseminar to ask then have to email and wait for a repli delay on get start with whatev it is
i would love a mix of live class and discuss i feel like i’m onli learn what i need to learn for the discuss and not understand the overal subjectimport of certain thing
becaus you are abl to work through the materi like it would be taught in a face to face lectur it also help it be record as it is more engag and so you are abl to understand and absorb the inform more success you can also go back over the lectur if you miss someth someth you wouldn’t necessarili be abl to do in a live zoom lectur
abl to interact with the teacher
mean i actual have to do the work
make you feel engag
you can take your time to fulli understand the content be explain and go through the video at your own pace
felt closest to normal
give the opportun for further question and elabor
i can work at my own pace and timescal it work around my employ and my free time
easier to follow
becaus i can rewatch the video if i’m find the work difficult
you onli can follow the class then and there no procrastin possibl which is perfect for someon like me who doe most thing veri last minut you need to concentr and follow that exact class and you can’t go back to repeat what ha been said which is in my opinion the closest thing to an actual fysic class of cours teacher will also all answer your question that may occur on the spot which is conveni as well
good to paus at ani moment to make sure i fulli understand the content
as a discuss about the topic can make it easier to absorb the inform
due to slow internet connect it is the most feasibl and access method
it more dynam and it make it easier to discuss
as an essenti worker record lectur meant i wasnt miss out and could schedul learn around my work hour
becaus there is more interact and you can ask question and reciev answer immedi
becaus one can creat their own schedul fit person prefer of work ie earli in the morn in the even everyth in a big chunk or decid into small portion
more interact
more motiv to actual do the work i get to see my classmat
teach is more direct and i believ is most compar to the typic lectur style learn we are use to as an undergradu student
to be abl to coher voic my understand and opinion on work as well as to engag with that of other and get expertis from the academ all in real time and as normal as possibl
i have to piec thing togeth to be abl to understand it it doesnt allow me to zone out as easili as record lectur or live class
becaus i can learn the materi whenev i want and depend on my wifi connect
i feel like it engag me more with what we are learn wherea have record lectur doesn’t motiv me or make me want to learn the materi as much thi is becaus if it’ record i feel like it will alway be there but have a teacher present and who is activ tri to engag your attent make me want to learn more about the subject be taught
allow me to watchlearn at my own pace
it allow more time for question to be answer and method to be explain in further depth it’ less restrict
most like ‘normal class’ and quicker to ask question
i can do my work in my own time i don’t find that it’ veri help for teacher to have video becaus a lot of time is wast talk about thing that we could just read instead but thi is probabl just becaus of my learn style
easier to go back on record lectur if i don’t understand someth
it interact i feel like im get direct feedback we can discuss and i have to particip so im less distract
becaus i can ask my teacher qs on the spot when i dont understand what he teach
seem easier than no interact lesson at all at the moment they set work on microsoft team
it’ easi to access can paus and replay less anxieti induc than zoom and you can still email lectur with ani question
it’ nice to interact and make me actual watch them if they were record i would just put it off
i can rewatch it ani time
i can learn more on my own it seem more effici
allow more flexibl to choos the schedul
becaus you can have a chat and it’ easier to understand andor ask question
becaus live class alway have technic issu and peopl speak over each other discuss forum and upload materi dont let you absorb as much
it’ the onli one i have use and that my teacher have set up
less interact with peer
i can do the work in my own time at my own pace
feel most similar to normal in person lesson and allow for question throughout and better commun with the teacher
it allow interact between student and teacher
i can ask question and it‘ more person
i learn best on my own for the most part anyway with still a bit of guidanc
immedi student teacher interact
class collabor
live lectur like zoom or adob connect make me feel anxiou and guilti for not particip and interact with the prof so record lectur eas that anxieti but still have the benefit of aural learn
most interact stimul
so i can do the work whenev i want to
can watch anytim you want great to have flexibl
can easili commun in real time with visual stimuli
it is the closest thing to face to face discuss
it wa a virtual classroom that allow me to interact with everyon i could see everyon and talk to everyon it wa also veri engag i think i would have fallen asleep if i just had to watch record
i find it more flexibl around my time i can do the work when ever i want in the day and it won’t interrupt my person life thi allow me to not organis my day round a video call that may not be use if i need help i just email
so far it’ the onli one i have tri
less work and more normal amount of work
interact and feedback feel connect
fun and i get to see all my teacher and friend
becaus i can see my friend
it take twice as long to cover lectur materi yourself from just upload slide and note a live lectur would also help to maintain daytoday structur
there is an opportun for student to interact with other peer and the lectur
it somehow still feel like be in a class where everyon gather in one place record video wouldnt requir much of my energi as i can paus at ani time but that mean i can be more tempt to shift my attent elsewher
more engag easier to ask questionsinteract with lectur and classmat
i like the written materi book i get i just prefer learn by myself
i feel as though im activ learn rather than mindlessli read from a screen
more interact
can be paus and stop to take note and engag with what’ be written
easier to engag in the learn materi and allow discuss of topic
the most engag form of onlin learn from my perspect of cours help me feel connect with my instructor and classmat which in turn make me connect more to the materi and encourag through sens of commun abil to ask question as i learn new materi and creat discuss within “classroom” that lead to more critic think from my experi it is more detail and concept stick most easili
more interact abl to ask question and receiv feedback in real time
can easili watch at my own pace
can rewatch them until i understand the content
it’ the most true to in person learn
i like to work in my own pace as i struggl to understand content when someon is constantli talk eg in a lectur i find when there is upload content such as a word document with a read task and question i can move in my own pace and take my own time to learn the materi
make sure im there at that specif time to maintain a healthi rythm to my day
more interact
i think it becaus lectur have the option to put up their materi up as well and explain well as progress through the slide show
i enjoy face to face learn better
mainli becaus upload materi is the onli thing i have experienc i am yet to take an onlin live class or discuss howev i get extrem uncomfort on call with lot of peopl and work better when left to my own devic and just to get on with it
becaus it’ still that face to face commun and still feel kinda like a normal class
becaus i can interact with my instructor and classmat and i can make question
becaus i can go back if i don’t understand someth
more independ
it meant that we could interact with our lectur in that moment it also provid structur to my day and meant that i wa account for do work whilst at home
my uni did record lectur with discuss on zoom afterward which wa actual great it had the classroom benefit of discussionquest etc but now that i am take my exam i am love be abl to revisit the old lectur
it most close resembl a real class that i am use to attend and hold me account at a time when it is veri easi to slip into procrastin
to watch it ani time when i can
i can do it in my own time and enjoy what i’m learn more
abil to ask question and engag with the teacher
easi access to teacher and debat more motiv
you can watch in your own time
all of the work is clearli written so you can go back and make sure you are do what you are suppos to be
i can get the explan from a person and rewind it etc until i fulli understand
easi to watch at my own pace
video call are stress and not veri product it’ difficult to hold class discuss due to delay etc and make sure everyon understand the content take twice as long becaus question feel more disrupt when a teacher is in the middl of a lectur becaus you can’t rais your hand befor you ask i prefer just work remot and be email powerpoint and worksheet becaus i feel as though the onli inform i won’t gain from those is class discuss which isn’t veri success onlin
it make me feel less alon
you can watch in your own time
i like to be abl to see everyon and still have that interact with peopl even if it’ not in person
you can watch it anytim and also rewatch it you can also paus it so if they are go too fast to take it down in your copi you have time also if you zone out for a few second you can rewind it
it is more engag
i like to be set the work upfront work through it at my own pace use the power point write my assign then ani question i have i email and my teacher quickli respond
you can go at your own pace whilst still get input from the teacher
can stop and rewind if need and can be done in my own time
you can ask question dure the class
upload materi with no live explan or a chanc to ask question make me feel like i could sign my name instead of the teacherslectur after the cours ha end and there no point of go to the uni in the first place when i can have to learn everyth by myself
easier to understand inform
i prefer be abl to rewindrewatch the lesson at a later time if i didn’t comprehend them well enough the first time
i find it easier to focu when i can read in silenc i have anxieti and am veri sensit to nois so i can’t focu when peopl are say thing to me upload or email materi are thing that i can use at my own pace in my own relax environ and so i find these easier to learn from
it easi to start and stop the lectur and learn the materi more thoroughli when in onlin call class i find it hard to grasp materi becaus the professor dont have the abil to see the reaction of student to the materi they cant grasp when student are lost
more of an acoust learner and easier to understand concept
becaus it allow me to work at my own pace and i dont depend on be connect all the time
it easier to paus rewind and come back to after the first video watch
interact and feel nome normal
you can get person feedback but still work in your own pacetim
you get to take your own time to fulli understand the content without be carri away
can ask question in real time
it forc me to pay attent and i am abl to easili ask question of my teacher and particip in group discuss it also make me feel connect to peopl and feel less lone
becaus it is the most realist and similar method to normal class
easi access at whatev time of day
if your wifi is dodgi live class may be quit glitchi and you may miss import info while with upload materi you’v got lot of time to look at the info
becaus it is most similar to regular class in school
becaus you can get question answer immedi rather than wait hour for a repli over email
becaus we can be face ti face with both our class and teacher and get question answer in real time
it simul the classroom environ more accur my english class use thi for feedback on our coursework and thi just allow us to develop work use our train of thought that can’t be commun on other platform also it allow the class to gain idea from other feedback and just in gener made me feel less isol in the first few week when i wa digest the fact that a level were done
i can get my question answer at that given time
it feel like privat one on one tutor
freedom
becaus it’ the most interact and mean i can get respons to question live rather than have to wait for them to get back
can take my time and still get a teacher to talk me through the work
live class can be hard to focu on and for me discuss can feel inauthent and unhelp when not face to face
more interact and live can ask question if you don’t understand
it feel like your in an actual class and you can as help as soon as you need it without wait for long repli
less awkward than quiet zoom tutori but same inform
much more interact and feel closest to be in a real class
i want to studi when i want
it let you complet onlin work without anxieti of use zoomonlin chat in your own home
easier to focu when you feel up to it
more interact
easi and organis as i have a schedul to follow
becaus i can watch it whenev i want
you get to be in real time with your classmat so you still get interact with friend
instructor are activ teach the materi as oppos to expect student to teach themselv complet
becaus it give me the freedom to adjust the learn to my person schedual for exampl i know i’m at my best in term of focus and be engang in the learn at night and have the class record allow me to get the most out of them and my concentr
i struggl to manag my time in quarantin sometim and with record lectur i ca watch them when it’ conveni
smallgroup teach where you can discuss your thought and bounc idea off your peer is alway the most construct in my opinion also i studi foreign languag so it’ imper to often be speak and hear them
so i wa actual account to go through the lectur and listen properli for the whole lectur
can do it at whatev time you wanf
interact and focu
your abl to engag with the other student and the teacher in real time receiv help instantli etc
it’ interact i learn through discuss and via a forum it’ easi to see the discuss and to contribut
becaus if the class are live i have to watch them when theyr schedul and then i dont procrastin as much
you can ask question without it be awkward
i feel like i’m most product in an offici set and becaus live class give me that i prefer it compar to the other also i get see my classmat and can have open discuss with them too
ani question that i may have would gener be answer at that moment and it also provid me with a similar set to classroom so content is taught verbal
i find it is veri import to interact with teacher still i would have found record lectur to be uninteract
it is the closest to be in an actual classroom which therefor provid the best learn it also ensur we are kept in the ‘school mode’ when work
i am abl to skim back and forth through the video in case i miss ani point
can engag with the other student
it’ as if we are in a classroom and we can get work done togeth at a regular pace rather than at an irregularli fast pace bc teacher pile work on and think it’ faster to do bc you do it on your own
motiv
can do at your own pace
easi to ask question and you feel more connect
i can see my work in front of me and do it on my own time
make it easier for me to block out my time and keep it flexibl
it’ nice to actual listen to the tutor explain a concept
pre record lectur allow more flexibl and are less exhaust than live class but are more in depth than upload materi or forum
cu ur acc gettin matiri like in class
you can get instant feedback on work have commun to give you a sens of normal and also as a music student it’ pretti tricki to do without it
feel of everyon sit there at the same time togeth feel of account structur to the day
interact
it allow me to take time to write my note and go over part that i dont understand veri well and think about the question that i can send to my teacher afterward
can watch them in your own time paus it when you don’t understand or tri to write note
do it at own pace especi in isol with mix emot
easier to focu and take in inform
becaus i can interact with my professor and friend which make social distanc easier
we can connect with the teacher ask if we have ani doubt and it feel more like a classroom
i like to learn by myself under the instructur
abl to ask question in real time and you are actual be taught rather than teach yourself
i think it would be more engag and flexibl at the same time not that i have yet experienc it
video are more engag than other materi and concept can be explain in further detail
live class still feel somewhat like in person lectur
i never open the upload lectur slide but if i had a schedul onlin class to attend i would have attend
i am in mostli math class and thi way i am abl to paus understand the concept and then move on which give me a greater understand the first time i learn someth becaus i can go at my own pace we have offic hour for ani question so i can have one on one discuss with my professor that way
i can choos the time when i can concentr the best
direct interact with teacher and classmat
becaus teacher explain have more knowledg and experi than textbook
it help me to engag with the materi and complet work that is benefici to my learn
face to face teacher contact
selfmotiv and selfdirect learn clarif can then be made in the next “live class” so it ensur better learn
i have time to focu
it allow the teacher to explain fulli and in a way they know their class will understand
more close mimic an in class experi also requir less self motiv learn
it hard for me to concentr and feel motiv sinc we are in quarentin but the other altern wouldnt work as well becaus i would often procastin but i would like of my class had more interact
i’m a hand on learner so video meet for class is almost like have class in person
i can look at is as mani time as i need to and transfer it into a form of learn of my choic which will help me absorb it better i can also do it in my own time
most like how i would’v been learn materi if it wasn’t for covid so don’t need to learn a whole new routin and requir less self motiv as i know i have to attend the class rather than should i do the work now or later etc
it feel more interact
record lectur allow me to studi the content my own time and at my own pace howev if i don’t complet the lectur in a certain time frame then i will more work to do
i can work at my own pace
i find zoom call veri disengag so i like to be abl to go at my own pace with prerecord content
becaus i can go back and relisten to ani inform that i miss when write note
i am more awar of the content as have to concentr to keep up with the convers self direct work is not alway complet
can do your note in your own time and aren’t restrict by time for zoom call
own pace
lectur were often unhelp and felt pointless
more interact and can ask question also it feel more like a class and i’m more like to engag in the materi
play paus and rewind as my pace so don’t have the ad pressur of onli get one chanc to understand the content
i feel like in some way i still get to interact with my teacher basic maintain as close as possibl my relationship with them
i wa abl to go back if i didn’t understand a materi clearli
easier to focu allow for worktop to be explain well
i prefer to read
it feel nice to interact and see our teacher especi in these tri time ani sort of social interact is welcom
student can go at their own pace and understand properli
it possibl to just ask question at the time and also see my classmat and how theyr do even if it by a webcam
i can rewatch the video
like to work at my own pace and at my own time
i feel more connect to the teacher and my classmat therefor i feel more connect to what we are do and just see the peopl i would normal see properli everyday in real life is nice even if it is through a screen it make me feel happier
it forc me to engag with the content i cant dissoci and pretend the work doesnt exist if i have to discuss it with a teacher
more interact and social
record lectur can be access at ani time wherea live class mayb miss due to the time schedul
it take most of the stress out of class and give us the possibl to learn at our own pace
upload materi tend to be regurgit from the textbook wherea live lesson tend to be richer in explan and i person find it easier to learn audibl
it easier for me to keep track of thing and do all my studi my way of i can just shove everytth into a folder and then go from there without jave to watch lecturesb in a class and depend on other
can do it on my own time and rewatch part if need
i think class discuss are such a use way to learn and thi is easiest to do on zoom
becaus i understand better when their is actual work i tend to not focu when a teacher is explain someth through live
can watch in your own time paus the video to process info without have to rewatch the lectur later on
you can hear the teacher actual explain the content rather than look and read lesson powerpoint and tri to work it out from onli the inform on the slide
more interact can ask question use for tutori workshop etc
more interact with the teacher and classmat help give more structur to my day
as much interact as i can get these day
more interact more like to particip in the learn
it keep student engag and replic a standard classroom enviro it also eas the switch the onlin learn as a timet is still put in place
we are abl to watch back lesson and also complet thing in our own time when we work best instead of have to go with a schedul time like on a zoom call
flexibl and you can go back a listen again if you need to revis or write an essay
it is more engag and by far the best method in my school
live chat are much easier to foster and creat discuss than someth like zoom we have record lectur as well but when my lectur doesn’t write anyth on the slide it take me 3 time as long to watch it and take note
can refer back to it if missedtoo quick
more engag
as i can decid to do it when i want onlin call are so useless i much prefer a prerecord video of someon go through the materi so i can work at my own pace
for the one cours i had as a live class i wa more attent and had a structur time to when i had to be present i prefer to listen to someon speak than to read becaus i know i respond best when i can hear the tone or passion that the speaker ha for the content we are learn it also made the professor more access if i had further question
more interact and easier to ask question
real time interact happen and if well conduct the discuss can lead to actionperson project the later i have onli experienc dure inform webinar usual not direct by he institut
i can paus if i get distract and make sure i go back a bit if i get lost
becaus you can watch them anytim you want it much better to do so when we are in the mood to learn
allow us to do in our own time still allow materi to be explain
i can ask question as we go along and becaus it’ live it feelsi don’t realli know less weird and i feel more like i’m a student which is someth i’v gotten to realiz is import in these month for normalci and keep sane
more interact
i like to do it in my own time and be abl to paus it to note take or re watch bit live zoom call are harder to stay focus on than if i can paus it and work through it at my own pace
can do in my own time as often not awak earli
i am a visual learner if the record video had visual with the teacher i would prefer that but just listen to a record would not help me
it is more interact and teacher explain more as more question are ask
can watch whenev suit me
it wa the next best thing to actual be in a class it make it feel like the tutor care more if it is live
im find it hard to self motiv myself when work alon with no schedul so i would rather have a more structur lesson with my classmat and teacher i also prefer to work in group which is not as easi with email work
i can paus to take note and i can watch them when the hous is quiet enough to not get distract
i can learn at my own time and pace
i can rewatch the part i miss for record lectur
were abl to engag with the instructor much more by ask question rather than just listen to a record
we haven’t actual gotten to do ani zoom call but i think it would be good if we did caus the teacher could actual go through thing with us rather than just set work
less time wast
more conveni
can studi at ani time
i enjoy be abl to ask question in class i think if i wa a freshman in mostli gen ed class i would like record lectur so i could increas the speed of the lectur
feel more like we’r i’m a classroom it’ more engag and i feel like i’m learn and benefit more than just complet pre set materi alon
better interact more person
i can do it in my own time
more interact
it’ the most interact and feel as close to be in actual lectur as possibl
you get to ask question and have a normal convers
we have the freedom to stop whenev we want and watch them earlierlat
becaus i can ask the teacher question directli dure the lesson
it is the most similar experi to class that we had befor the lockdown and give the best experi as thing could be solv in the same way and clarif could be made easier than in other mode in addit it creat a classroom atmospher better than the other mode which i find help
i wa abl to ask question and interact with my classmat and professor
i feel like i am an actual student in a class engag and critic think with my peer when i just watch a video or read someth onlin that feel like what i could do by myself in my free time anyway
if i don’t understand someth i have the option to rewind and studi it again
discuss chatsforum stimul discuss in real life and forc everyon to particip instead of it be passiv learn
it mean i would be abl to ask question and have then answer straight away allow follow up question to also be ask and answer
mimic what we would have in univers normal
i can work at my own pace
i find it easi to interact and commun with my teacher
it is easier for us to make question and interact with the teacher it creat a much more dinam atmospher than other method
i prefer record lesson as i am abl to rewind and take down note especi dure thi time with exposur to a new routin and way of learn i find it extrem use to be abl to rewatch lesson in order to fulli comprehend the topic and ensur i am caught up with all work and understand by the time school are open again
more effect as i could interact with the tutor and make decis on the lesson which is realli help to conduct the inform in the most easier way in that lockdown
it provid the abil to ask question and it also make me get up in the morn with prerecord lectur i can watch them whenev and it’ so much easier to procrastin do so
i struggl to learn without interact so i can sort of bounc my understand off into other peopl and develop my idea it also help me hear concept in new perspect also human behaviour is vari and it make the lesson and content significantli more memor
becaus we can ask question while the teach is occur if we are stuck so if we do not understand thing it is much easier to get help it is also a mix of a discuss forum and a lectur so i find it a got balanc between the two
as i would get more stuff i do i have just been upload work but have i been learn and understand the topic i do not that much
becaus it allow for discuss and interact bounc off my tutor and other student challeng my assumpt and help me to see angl i might not have otherwis consid it also reduc feel of isol and remind me i’m part of a cohort
easi to see what need to be done
i can take note on my own way
becaus question appear as the class develop so i can ask them in that moment and have a clear answer
i get to learn at my own pace while still be abl to learn visual and auditor from my teacher
my part time job as a univers student suddenli becam a full time job becaus of the coronaviru i work in a clinic have prerecord lectur or upload content allow me to actual finish my semest as i would not have been abl to attend live class although it might not be an ideal method for learn effect it allow me to not miss out on anyth discuss formu were also open to discuss the materi afterward
it feel the most natur to me plu see people’ face help and keep me motiv
it a more engag way of learn and can be complet at a time that conveni when compar to upload materi
student can get a much better understand of the cours materi as the teacher can go more indepth into the work and explain thing rather than just upload work for student to tri and teach themselv
it more schedul help to creat a routin
you can interact with peopl more easili
it give me motiv
more engag and i’m more motiv to attend
it the closest thing to a normal classroom
easier to retain inform as you can listen to what the lectur are say as well as view the powerpoint
i dont have enough motiv to do it by myself and set a time of the day to do it
it feel more person and make the experi more normal email at teacher a question about the work leav time for you to becom distract whilst wait for a repli wherea if you are in a more classroom like set your question can be answer almost immedi
there is more time allow when answer question and there is no pressur associ with get someth wrong in front of your classmat
i’m a slow writer so i like to be abl to paus thing
a more flexibl way to learn especi as an intern student
feel more real
more focus
closest mode to real physic lectur
live class are more interact keep me motiv and engag
more interact
can break up the lectur and have more break
the virtual face to face interact
i want to feel like i’m still go to a lesson real interact and discuss with the teacher abil to dedic time in the day to work rather than it be at my own accord
becaus i feel like email resourc give me no motiv and it just feel like endless homework wherea record lessonslectur give me the zone and atmospher of an actual lesson so im more motiv and abl to concentr while still give me the flexibl to look after my mental health and be abl to help support my famili and keep on top of everyth els at home
talk help put informst in your head and record video can be rewatch until you unferstand it
more interact
like i mention i’m take a bachelor in danc so it’ a lot of practic work i prefer when we can do some onlin contemporari or ballet class
like i mention i’m take a bachelor in danc so it’ a lot of practic work i prefer when we can do some onlin contemporari or ballet class
can discuss with other class member and ask teacher question easili
it is more interact and i can see my teacher and immedi ask for ani help with the given task
i like to work at my own pace and then have the opporun to ask question in a seminar later rather than rush through note in a live lectur
becaus it’ live i feel like i’m be more engag and activ when listen to new materi
it is easier to learn under the current circumst but it also give me a flexibl schedul
i can rewatch it whenev i want if i need to
more interact actual make me complet yhe work in the hour not three
most similar to classroom but no need to get readi
direct inform with minimis interfer and rare ani technolog difficulti
if i have miss or i am unabl to attend the time for the live onlin lesson it will be so much easier if the lesson is record so not onli i can catch up on what i miss but also be abl to re watch it again later on if i am confus on a certain topic area
it is the onli way we receiv work so there is no comparison
social interact and more engag
less laggi and more effici
it a lot easier
allow for easier return to necessari materi and no social interact
it feel more normal and i have far more motiv to actual do the work set although it is more time consum and difficult in these time
becaus it allow you to start dialogu or ask questiond but you can also just sit back and listen to you teacher and other student
becaus i think we would get best educ with it but sadli we dont use it
becaus i can understand it easili
becaus then i could go back to the lectur and make sure i didn’t miss anyth import
the interact is a big part of my learn and i find i am much more like to ask question in person i am also less like to fall behind as there is the motiv to know what i’m say in class
i understand it easier and can ask question easili and fast
it is just about the same as catch up on a lectur you have miss
becaus there is more engag with cours content and you are abl to go into breakout room to collabor and discuss
most activ
i can ask question and receiv immedi answer from instructor so slidetoslid there no interrupt in my understand also attend a live class where attend is taken keep me account wherea if we onli had record lectur i may procastin and not studi them on time
interact and sens of learn togeth easier to talk to the professor
it’ easier for me to go back over thing i didn’t understand that first time around
it seem the most real compar to normal in class learn i still realli dislik it though
eas of access whenev you want most similar to lectur captur which is a familiar tool when use live class would have to remain mute anyway so not much more is gain out of a live lectur vs a pre record lectur for workshop session where topic question are answer would prefer a live class where the abil to ask a question there and then would be accept
more interact better understand of subject from actual discuss
you can engag with the other in your class
more discuss opportun to ask question collabor with peer
the lectur note are explain better and i can go at my own pace both faster and slower than the lectur goe i find it annoy constantli paus a video to take it in
more engag
flexibl time
interact with other
most interact way of onlin learn
most similar to inclass allow discuss to happen in front of everyon
me and my classmat are more engang in our class and i think it kind of make us feel more “normal” which is import right now
id rather engag with the teacher when learn new content review is fine for self teach small thingsreview but otherwis id rather see a person
easier to do on my own time
it is the closest thing to in person class
i can easili paus the video to take note or rewind to go back over someth i didn’t understand
becaus i can replay the part that i want to have a solid grasp of tho i would say that an add live session would be benefici so you can ask question directli
be interact while learn is veri benefici for me i like to ask question too
abl to watch it in your own pace
we can ask question and get a respons immedi also thi way the professor feel more engag and conduct the lesson in a more “normal” way it’ not as awkward and short as a record lectur with no student
as then the teacher can explain rather than have the student teach themselv which is harder
it feel like im in the classroom
non contact
becaus we can be face ti face with both our class and teacher and get question answer in real time
i can paus or rewind the video everyon can fit the video into their person schedul which is better than make everyon be onlin for a class at a time which may not suit all student
i can interact with other student have discuss which help me understand the topic and ask my totor question directli
i’m not comfort with talk
it allow interact
live
live class usual are more extens in time and my attent spam is not capabl of handl it for more than 20 to 30 of onlin learn record lectur have a tendenc to have a 20 minut limit make it more barrabl
easi to rewatch so can take everyth in
becaus i am abl to learn by myself and i have all the resourc i then need
live in a third world countri the internet is unstabl most of the time so have zoom meet would be a hassl for a lot of student
i can take my time and make sure i’v understood the content by paus etc
more freedom with time and way of understand less constraint everyon learn differ
thi wa the onli option we were given as a school
becaus i’m not veri familiar with other one sinc 90 of time they use thi mode of teach
flexibl
i’d get longer contentsam as i’d been get befor and be abl to engag live with the materi
close thing to a real class but less social awkward and i can watch in my own time although live class are also good as they give the day structur
allow me to choos when i watch the video and if im busi on a certain day i dont have to worri about miss a lectur
becaus i understand materi be spoke to me instead of read it myself becaus of my dyslexia
it is easier for the teacher to explain the topic we are learn and replic the classroom environ as well as for us to ask question face to face
becaus is the most similar to the class in person
it more interact and i find the whole class be there to ask and answer question with eachoth increas the effect of the learn experi
you can work at your own pace and if you ever need help you can just ask your teacher and they can contact you accordingli
as thi a more practic way to learn and have an opportun to bounc of each other i feel in a classroom learn environ i learn better i feel better and i am a better student be left to do it in my room for exampl i procrastin so much and don’t get it done
it allow student to be more engag with class materi even at home you cannot learn properli by just read it most of what you rememb is like to be what said
becaus i feel like i can refer back to the resourc given in further educ
it easier to watch back take note and the professor are somewhat compet in the technolog as the major of our lectur were record in the past also
i still get a full lesson from my teacher without have live confront and i can also rewatch it as much as i need to understand the content it is better than discuss forum becaus other student aren’t read my work
the abil to paus and write notestak break
i prefer thi becaus i feel like i integr and appli the concept better
you can take your time to understand content and work through it at your own pace and without classroom pressur
it feel like i’m take lectur in class easi to ask question easi to discuss with other student
person connect
can watch in own time can paus it whenev to make note re play and dont have to see classmat who i might not like etc avoid ani anxieti etc surround by see peopl who you are now not have to see anymor
mire like to grasp more info
becaus i like to actual be abl to see my teacher and classmat and i think that have them there “live” to answer question and explain assign especi becaus thi type of learn is so new to all of the student is veri help
it allow me to go at my own pace faster or slower whatev i need
maintain the school routin best
becaus it allow me to go back and check thing as mani time as i need
becaus you can choos the time you are abl to work on the lectur and at which pace
it feel most like in person class
becaus i can alway refer back to it without wast much storag
becaus we have a spontan interact with our teacher and classmat
becaus i can manag my schedul more effici if i have record lectur you can finish your assign and then listen to everyth that you miss thi week
abl to ask question when someth is live there not the option to slack take a break so you cant get distract
i dont have to show up nor watch long video i can work at my own pace and still slay it
can paus the video becaus have lesson record might have poor audio at some point so it good to have it abl to replay again and again
it allow to interact with fellow student and the lecturerseminar leader to ask question and have that interact of a normal class
i prefer discuss chat as you can take the time to formul an answer and the idea between peopl seem to flow better thi is oppos to tri to mimic in person organ discuss via zoom which i have found to be clunki and unsuccess
still interact with your lectur
to be interact and can ask question immedi when need
it is conveni and i can watch them at anytim
becaus one can freeli choos when to do the assign
becaus my univers is had alwayd onli offer onlin cours and thi is the onli mode ive use
it’ more hand on and i can connect with other peopl rather than just watch video
becaus i learn best when in an interact environ and i’m abl to talk to peopleask question i find i have less motiv to watch record compar to turn up to a class
we can interact and it is easier to learn but i like when they upload materi as well it take less time to learn
access anytim
you still have the engag with the teacher and the class you’r abl to activ discuss and ask question
interact it live and happen so it creat a routin and structur for the day
it i easier to look back on and to becom more flexibl with the time
can do it at my own pace
help you gain a base understand of content do that you can build knowledg through assign
i feel more account for my learn and it help to see other peopl
we can alway go back to review the lectur video anytim at our own pace
dure live class it’ veri chaotic and noisi becaus some peopl have loud background nois so chat and forum i think are a better way to ask question and clarifi doubt becaus when you write what your think you pay more attent to make sure that the way your phrase sentenc make sens also even if wifi connect is slow at least you’ll still be abl to send messag which will eventu reach than have to wait for a person screen to unfreez
abl to ask question in real time
i like know i’m still interact with other ie i can interact with peopl in real time see their face etc it’ also easier to ask question when the teacher is right there
i have time to read or view the content and go back as much time as possibl
more engag
it resembl a physic class more than the other mode and i feel that we engag better with the teacher thi way
more interact
it can be access at ani time and anywher so with the covid situat everyon routin have shift and it allow for peopl to complet the work when it best fit them instead of have a specif zoom call or confer call time slot
i have to stay in a schedul
qualiti discuss
easi to engag with and can watch in your own time
prefer the anonym as i don’t like to activ particip and also allow for freedom with when to watch it
can do them in your own time and own schedul
student can fulli engag with the class and discuss with fellow
allow me to fulli understand new concept through visual present and be abl to see how the teacher goe through them also it allow me to focu more
can do it whenev
it forc me to learn the materi and understand it more
more engag
so i am abl to keep up with the work
becaus it more easier to ask question and it would be more like school set rather than send so mani email to clear stuff out
so i am abl to studi when i am free and in the mood to do so or even if i want to review the class again it easier to do so
i can watch it whenev paus and take note and bring up the playback speed
it a video of someon explain so easier to comprehend and also easier to take note from becaus it pauseabl
it is more engag and collabor
i can still interact with my teacher as my class are small enough to
live class give me anxieti
best we’v been offer
immediaci and still a human connect element
allow for actual engag rather than paddiv listen
easier to stay engag and be interact with the materi also abil to ask question
closet thing to inclass learn
i like studi at my own pace and not rush to write down note while the professor is live and they’r scroll through the screen rather quickli
i am abl to go through the content at a pace that suit me best
easier to commun
the conveni of be abl to do my uni work when i choos to around my busi worklif schedul
i can go back a rewatch if i don’t understand someth and can take my time and not feel rush
it allow you to share idea and feel more like you are in the classroom it also mean you are complet a realist amount of work within your lesson time frame
it allow me to work through the content at my own pace
i can learn at my own pace and paus and take break but still feel as though i’m not have to explain content to myself my teacher would have otherwis
it requir live social interact and a structur schedul that maintain a sens of normalci
although it’ not ideal and i don’t prefer the onlin learn but it’ the closest to the real studi settingcolleg class room
becaus i can watch at my own pace and make note with draw that i fulli understand
interact in real time but i would prefer upload or email materi for assign and project so we could have our time and do it at our own pace
commun idea onlin need to be more interact than face to face lecturesclass as class is easili done in a passiv way otherwis and learn isn’t solid
i find zoom meet realli hard to have good discuss in a lot of the nonverb cue of convers are not in zoom and it an extra level of uncertainti that is stress
becaus we have the teacherprofessor right in front of us to help us with our assign
i like the interact with teacher and actual be abl to answer question as if in a lesson
engag with the materi
it’ more access
it’ more interact and it’ in real time so you can ask question and get them answer straight away
i current live in a differ timezon 11 hr which made zoom class challeng
be abl to see fellow classmat and my teacher
i can rewatch the lectur again if i dont understand the topic discuss
get to ask question directli live discuss etc
it put pressur on me which is need for me to actual complet task
it’ the closest to a presenci class and i can ask question while the professor teach and expos the subject
flexibl in where and when i can attend my class i could also stop or speed up the video as need it wa also help to have these video as anytim dure revis i need to refresh my learn i could go back to these video
zoom wa awkward difficult to “speak up” in
slightli more account and the face to face interact help me focu
i get anxiou about attend in person but especi onlin with camera as there’ no way you can “hide” i guess and the increas pressur to contribut
social interact
can do at ani time anywher
becaus the philippin educ is teacher center and attend live class is just listen to a monologu of a teacher at a slow pace the onli thing pull up is the powerpoint slide and most of them don’t know how to annot or to write on the ppt or just don’t have the resourc like an ipad or appl pencil so it get realli confus when there are no visual and it is veri awkward to ask question or to engag becaus some teacher could get realli annoy becaus we disrupt her pace it is not a mode of teach problem per se but it just ha to do with the cultur of learn here with record video i can watch the lectur in 2x speed
suit my subject best languag and human
becaus i am abl to check it over and over when i miss a detail in the lectur
at school
it easier to stay on track when you have to attend a live class vs watch a prerecord one and there are more opportun for interact
i can do work when i like without pressur
interact
it can be done in your own time and can be pausedsp upslow down if need in comparison live class are tire and it can take a long time to get point across if it requir particip be it becaus of lag or becaus peopl dont want to particip person ive found it a lot harder to actual particip becaus it feel like your not realli talk to anyon but everyon can hear you
becaus you can still have tradit lectur and seminar
it’ quit the same thing as at uni
becaus i can keep watch over it if i’m cinfus
it the easiest way to get inform and is usual the most straightforward form pf the inform provid
abil to ask question in real time and get feedback
easier to learn from more practic
as it is the most person one although it obvious doe not compar to in person
give me more flexibl as an essenti worker to do my uni work and not feel like i’m miss out becaus i’m have to work more
more interact and can engag and ask question you want
it is easier to understand content with explan rather than upload materi
easier to use from
it’ easier to take my time to follow along
read assign rather than listen watch help me to better understand
it conveni
i find it hard to stay on a schedul when i have record lectur and don’t have ani mandatori live session
i get to work through the set task in my own time
student can work at own pace
more interact allow for increas attent
proper one to one teach
more engag
it help me more to studi
flexibl
thing can be easili explain that way
can go at my own pace
i feel as though the way in which i learn best is not through a teacher actual teach the materi but through my classmat and i use our collabor skill to solv the problem ourselv i then know that i will not be singl out and i also know that my classmat are kinda struggl as well and therefor the classroom set pressur is weaken
you can work in your own time as is conveni
give the opportun to particip in discuss but with time to think and put your thought in order
use multipl sourc
most interact similar to classic classroom learn
doubt get solv quicker one on one mail with the professor is more benefici than sit for an entir lectur where there is no realtion to someon els doubt and yourssometim zoom can be a bit frustrat especi when you suddenli have bad net issu and cant attend a lectur mail are way more depend in such situat
i can paus the video when need
i like the sens of have class with fellow student and be abl to chat with them in the zoom chat featur or ask the professor question in real time
closest thing to a real lectur
it feel a bit more easier sinc a teacher is present and there’ a sens of normalci sinc ur friend are present in the live class
i can watch the record lectur or video at my prefer speed base on my level of understand
asynchron allow me to work lost my job due to the pandem so now work all possibl hour
much more interact and engag
i am abl to complet the cours work at ani given time instead of dure a certain hour period while the onlin class is take place
i can go back and watch them ani time
it’ easier for time manag and there are less issu such as bad connect when you’r about to start your class
you can ask question and build off of other student
i actual enjoy both zoom lesson and record lectur the record lectur are great if they’r broken down into small video rather than one larg video i can then revisit thi materi if need be
i can refer back to the video and will not miss anyth els
i can go at my own pace but it also give me a sens that i’m learn from an actual human as oppos to upload materi
becaus i get to retain inform at my own pace
can do own studi more independ
more interact
it actual depend on the professor but in my experi we usual wast too much time with live class tri to set everyth up
becaus it feel like i’m still in routin
more interact with the teacher and my peer
it easiest to ask question and engag with other student in an activ discuss
becaus teacher can actual explain the materi to me and i can more easili understand the subject
opportun to have a more natur interact and ask question as they form
becaus you can watch it when it’ more conveni for you sometim dure live lectur you can have emerg or technic problem which can caus you not to be abl to attend
i am abl to ask question and get an immedi respons
becaus i can watch these in my own time and i imagin that there would be less distract or technic difficulti than in a live call but more detail inform on the topic than in discuss chat or on upload materi
becaus i can come back to the cours whenev i need to unlik live session that are some time too earli or last for a veri long time
it the closest to the classroom like actual lectur
when i am at home i am unabl to adher to a tradit schedul in the same way as it depend on my family’ plan as well i think live class are import but should be use as a supplement rather than primari mean
becaus we can email the teacher if we need help
becaus i can learn thing at my own time and at my own pace
i am primarili a visual learn so i dont mind read howev pair with the lectureaudio of the instructor i find the cours to be so much easier to make an a in especi in an onlin format it help me understand how the teacher wordswant thing done versu just intepret the info on my own and have some conflict i also like have record versu live so that i can listen againon my own time
abil to ask question and interact with other student
there is no pressur to join a zoom call at a certain time ideal dure lockdown as allow for a more flexibl schedul which ha help me to cope but i like see and hear my lecturer’ voic as it help me learn better than just a discuss forum
engag and student are abl to post question on the spot
can watchrewatch at my own pace
it make one to one interact possibl
zoom anxieti
you can actual engag with the teacher and discuss the materi in real time which i find more use in my own learningspeci if i have sever question or if the answer to the question i had in the first place lead to even more question idk realli i guess it the closest thing to a real life facetofac discuss that we can have at the moment
it is a live discuss with teacher and other student
becaus if i have question or am confus about someth i can easili ask my instructor at the end of the session instead of have to wait and reach out individu to my instructor
similar to normal teach without the pressur of zoom
live interact
face to face
can go at your own pace
lesser interrupt can be use time time again
person i can ask question then and there and get an instant respons it the most similar to a normal lesson
i find im more engag and it nice to be abl to ask question and get respons the visual also realli help it just nice to see everyon again
i like to work through materi at my own pace with adhd it is hard to focu on a laptop screen for an hour especi watch live lectur
interact
interact help me learn
record or live class
student can easili paus or replay the video to better understand the content
can get anoth perspect on the materi instead of just read the basic in a book or in a slideshow get to hear the teacher also help feel more engag and like school still matter
i get anxiou if i have to interact live with other on zoom or in a discuss plu it is conveni sinc i work dure the day and can access it whenev
it allow for better and easier interact with both my teacher and my classmat
it is nice to see my teacher on live and have convers directli
interact get to see and speak to class member
i get to see and hear my classmat and teacher
with the few onlin class i have i have attend almost everi lectur and although the idea of record sound so much more appeal to me the realiti is i just never watch them and therefor my mark have been badli affect in those cours
i don’t like live class veri much becaus i have to be somewhat put togeth and have to sit through long lectur or instruct i prefer upload materi becaus i can complet them at my own pace whenev i decid to
it allow for more commun with teacher as in normal class
can go back to it and revis
becaus learn need to be collabor inord to be affect and that isnt achiev without regular interact and exchang though a call
more engag
as much interact as possibl when isol
i like social interact and i don’t learn from lectur
i feel i am in class with my teacher and friend
better commun abl to ask question
i can watch the content in my own time lot of flexibl
becaus i can alway refer back to it
have live class atleast give me some semblanc of be in a class and while i dont mind record lectur too live let us ask doubt right when we get them and even if theyr at weird hour of the day make me feel more like im at colleg than record
i can actual talk to my teacher and i feel like i’m actual in a classroom and not at home
the teacher can answer our question immed and everyth have better explan but i have a lot classmat with internet issu so it doesnt work well for them
i find that i am more engag in live class compar to prerecord lectur i like that i have the freedom of ask question in live class and enjoy engag with other peopl in my degre face to face
i feel like i get the actual “teaching” from the lectur without have to teach myself but i’m not tie down by watch it at a certain time or wast time go over a lot of question from other student
i am abl to replay part which u do not understand
the engag with the class is similar to what i had presenci
more indulg in the lesson sinc if it wa a record lesson i wouldnt probabl watch it
have more interact with professor
i’m easili abl to commun with my teacher in real time
you can get with your independ work and still check in call to discuss are the best
i can interact with my teacher
more effect
becaus you can ask question add inform to the class discuss the topic with the professor and classmat
i find it help be abl to interact with teacher and live class enabl for class discuss so further assist in mirror how learn would take place when physic at school i like how thi allow teacher to explain content in a similar way that they would at school
can interact with other and the lectur if need actual feel like a lectur unlik pre record one
allow you to have your own pace at learn the modul
it feel more collabor to have zoom lectur
i can watch in my own time alway forget about zoom meet
easi
it allow for greater interact with teacher and classmat
it give me the chanc to plan my own studi time
live class still provid in a way face to face interact where we can still ask teacher question live rather than later
im abl to learn at my own pace
zoom class are stress and i alway forget that they’r happen until it’ too late
it allow us to engag with the teacher and student more as if your have an actual lesson rather than do classwork by yourself with no guidanc
becaus i can make question and theyll be answer instantli and i feel that thi way make more dynam the learn
it’ easier to studi while watch or listen to the record video
becaus it fell the most like learn at the classroom
easier to ask question understand content due to inton sometim we get to actual do a task on the spot which is nice
it make interact between the professor and student possibl it almost feel like your in a class
it is veri simpl to understand and i just have to focu on what is upload instead of get wrap up on when meet are on zoom and tech issu
i can see it in my own time
becaus it give a sens of routin for the day and be at home is quit difficult to keep and routin and be in the studyuni mindset so have live class is a bit like attend a lectur although it is not the ideal it still give a uni feel even at home
i think that with mani subject is veri hard to just have a pre record video with a live class there is an interact that happen as it normal would have and you can have a real time qa that can happen with minim misunderstand and if there are misunderstand they can rectifi without a drag on potenti multiday email chain
give you your own time and is more interact
it’ easier to pay attent
forc me to actual listen
allow more interact with the professor that is closest to inperson interact which is the most use in my opinion
it’ the closest to what it’ like actual attend tutori in uni
enabl to work alon first and then ask question and discuss what you’r not sure about
i can work at my own pace without be put on the spot live
my teacher rare do live class as it would be unfair to kid who can’t attend becaus they have work or other oblig howev i realli like the few googl meet class i attend i find that i learn better by hear teacher explain the inform live becaus they can then gaug the classes’ reaction and adjust their explan as need the disconnect between informationhold and informationreceiv is too great without live class
i think that becaus there could be a technolog gap between student and teacher there’ a lot of time lost in live class just settl down
keep me account and is more interact and engag
interactioneasi to get feedback
i think it give a certain time flexibl to the cours for me person in lockdown my sleep schedul ha been all over the place and in gener i’d be shock if i wa awak at 10am for an onlin class so be abl to just work through a set amount of assign at my own pace is a lot nicer
can do in my own time and email for help if need
i am allow to work on my own schedul to work on assign
independ
work at your own pace is better
easier to work time around
allow most interact between the teacher and the student
becaus it’ better to understand the topic when the professor is use hi own word instead of just text
greater engag
i can alway look back at it to revis
i enjoy upload as they are more relax as to how much work they give us which let us breath especi with so mani core subject now
it veri practic you can take note at your own past and you can rewatch part that you didnt quiet understand it give the opportun to realli take your time when studi without feel constantli in a rush
i like the attempt to replic in person
allow activ particip
prerecord video make it easi to paus while i work or take note and take away the stress of be on a zoom call while provid more inform then upload materi do
it is interact and enabl a bit more of a q and a style you are also abl to talk to other student and see them vs record lectur which i also harder to be motiv to watch
becaus it is what i consid to be the most similar to a inperson class which is what work best for me as i can consult the teacher as i go and it allow spontan debat situat to aris
live class allow for much more connect between peopl and it the peopl who make univers what it is
own time own target
mimic in real life lesson
it is the closest to the direct classroom experi and it easier for the instructor not to forget they are talk to a specif group of student and not some abstract audienc
i have had to return to my home countri and the time zone is 6 hour off
becaus it allow me to see the lectur face to face as i would be see them in real life have a face talk is much more engag than have a record voic it also allow me to be less distract becaus i have a lectur talk and i am not just listen to some record
it resembl our regular class the most
so that i can review it ani time i want
becaus it conveni
i can ask question in the moment and i understand better if i see the screen of my professor im a comput scienc student discuss or email just wouldnt do it for me
becaus it conveni
becaus it conveni
live natur of it most resembl the normal version
i’v found that with onlin class there is a lack of particip becaus not everyon feel comfort to voic their opinion keep their camera and nois off with record lectur i feel i’m get the most out of learn becaus onlin class lack commun
it’ not pain awkward to sit in an onlin class and you can manag your prioriti myself
you can ask question in the chat and get a respons straight away
avail at ani time
im abl to complet all the task at my own pace not miss ani import inform
can do the work at my own pace easier to focu
you can ask question and get answer straight away
class discuss and you’r abl to understand it more
discuss are more interact and feel like an actual class it also depend on the subject howev
help me ask question etc and learn better
mostli dissert work
easi for understand and interact
more person and most similar to the real thing
live
i can watch the same lectur at my own pace
it help me stay focus becaus i know the teacher is watch me i can also ask question on the spot if i have ani
it is more close to in class learn
becaus it is still interact and mimic the feel of be in a class it allow for live question and more
connect issu is a seriou problem here
i’m current do a massiv open onlin cours mooc and here i’m access lectur video through youtub i find thi to be so much more of an effect learn method and more enjoy than in zoom
i prefer record lectur as it is similar to a live zoom call howev i am abl to learn at my own pace
becaus i feel pressur to actual do work
becaus i am abl to ask question on the spot when i do not understand the topic be taught and it is also the method that is nearest to a classroom set
it more engag i find it hard to have motiv for a particular subject and see peopl face to face like peer and teacher remind me who im do it for
live class are the most replic to face to face class which is my prefer it allow discuss
lot of interact we can ask lectur direct question
love tutori provid the opportun for interact and engag which isn’t gain through record materi it allow not onli for my understand of content and concept to be develop and enhanc through organ conversationact but also aid in the actual applic of content across more divers context in contrast i find it harder to engag and learn in the unit of mine which sole provid record tuteslectur and text
live interact class
it enabl discuss with the teacher and the class it feel more like an actual class
i like the person input and be abl to interact with the lectur and materi in some activ way
more space for interact
easier to understand bigger more complex theori
googl meet or zoom
becaus it hard for me to concentr on a live met sinc my parent and my younger sibl are home and they keep distract me unintent plu the whole concept of live met in my room with my pj and my phone and other distractionsmak it even harder
more interact learn for seminar
i get to do the work at my own pace instead of have to attend the zoom lectur at a certain time but i also do prefer upload assign
dure live class there may be mani technic glitch which may be avoid through the record clip of the lectur
easiest method and don’t have to join live class
the teacher can explain thing if student need to
i feel more connect to the peopl and can ask my professor a question right away rather than email them at 3am when im do my hw
can watch them whenev i want and can speed up the video
our teacher have been realli great at set up share doc and stuff so we can still engag with one anoth and i think that’ realli help for our learn but also i think it help a lot of student includ me with mental health and keep us from burn out while do school
with record lectur i’m unabl to ask ani queri that may come up dure the session and thi can be done with live session and the record lectur are usual from previou year
becaus in live class im abl to understand quickli and ask whatev a dont understand in that moment so doubt are solv much more quickli
interact
thi is my prefer mode becaus thi ha been the one of the onli mode introduc to me for onlin cours my school also use zoom and googl meet in the begin but i find these veri uncomfort and tough to use becaus of my home situat
the abil to have real time face to face interact with teacher and classmat
more interact
it more comfort and i can ask the teacher the question on chat
an activ learn environ i get to connect and talk to peopl ask question
more interact and activ collabor i did i can rememb thing better
my schedul would be more flexibl as i can decid when to watch the record lesson
allow for live engag in the subject i person learn best from see listen and do
while record lectur are more comfort to watch it easier to commun trough live class you can particip ask question etc also you have a sens of routin you have a lectur at a specif time
becaus it make me account to comment and engag with the content
i tend to get easili distract and one way learn without me be to abl to express my doubt and opinion would lead to me not understand the topic so i prefer have open discuss even with a big class
i can go at my own pace
it allow to work when you want you do not depend on your teacher schedul it take less time becaus onlin lesson usual take more time than actual lesson at school
it is the most interact and real time you can read people’ bodi languag better and ask question
can ask question
i get to paus or rewatch as mani time as need to make note and understand what is be instruct
thi is my prefer mode becaus i get to interact with the teacher and classmat more i can also ask ani question immedi if i have ani
it’ interact
you can easili ask question it feel a lot more like social then the other option
becaus you can go back to the lectur whenev you need to
no restrict of place
so i can paus the video whenev or rewind if i get lost
not everyon in class ha similar understand speed so teacher can explain onc in video we can watch how mani ever time we want
i can watch them on my own time and rewind if i miss someth
so flexibl to my timet
you can take your own time to studi
allow me to ask question
as i can return to the video later if i dont understand a certain topic
talk help with understand
i can do my class at whatev time i want and i can break it up into more manag chunk as our summer cours are acceler so a class is 35 hour break it up is way easier than sit in live class for 35 straight hour twice a week for each class
i can do the work at my own pace
mimic a normal class back in school
most interact
it provid a better medium to ask question as and when they aris and get instant feedback
becaus no one can disturb the lesson
can be done in our own time
more like normal
becaus i can interact with the class and i feel more like i’m at uni when i can see other student in the box
more interact within my cours make me much more motiv to complet the work
i can watch the lectur whenev i want to also i can make better note
engag
actual i felt absolut comfort with both the record and upload materi u can alway go back and refer unlik the zoom lectur that i do not prefer at all
i understand better when watch someth instead of read content
each person ha a differ pace so have a video allow you to paus it and actual understand and rewatch if need
i’m abl to have class discuss
becaus thi way i can watch the lectur when im free and rewind it if i dont understand someth also it easier to take note
more person interact
i can do it whenev i have time and want i can also paus and replay as mani thing as i like and make note howev it doe mean i can delay lectur until last minut too
zoom meet are less product than upload materi normal
the professor is abl to provid us with the same inform he would if we were in class so we arent miss ani key detail
record lectur are more flexibl enabl me to watch those lectur anytim i want to
allow me to watch the lectur in 2x speed and at my own time
i like interact than passiv i like get to particip in discuss
it feel like your in person so it easier to ask question and you feel like you have to go to class at a certain time
can complet in my own time
i can go at my own pace and the materi is there and access whenev i choos to do school work
allow quick interact if i have ani question
not depend on fix time
abl to complet at own pacedont have to stick to a lecturezoom call schedul
becaus we then could ask your teacher question math dure the lesson
becaus in onlin teach if you have doubt you can clear there onli immedi
easili access at all time of day
plan my time effect the day befor independ compar to a team call
interact is a veri import thing learn is incomplet without it
similar to normal class best way to interact which each other
i like learn by discusson
less stress
less distract and connect issu arent a problem
it easier to go back and review someth a teacher ha said
it help me to keep a consist schedul and allow for an opportun to interact and ask question of the professor and other student in real time
it is more interact
it more engag and more social
i prefer thi method becaus it allow you to stop andor listen again whenev you lost or didn’t understand some part of the explan but i think it should alway be connect with live class to ask question or discuss with other about the topic
becaus it requir particip and learn on a schedul it hard to keep motiv and not procrastin when you arent see your professor or classmat face to face
it too easi to zone out in onlin class so it easier to just teach myself
everyth make a lot more sens when someon is actual say it and go through the work but i realli hate call
allow for interact and ask question as well as provid structur by have a set schedul
can get it done all in one go
as we can activ ask question and clear our doubt it’ also more interact and i feel more oblig to attend do the work than when there are just materi provid
abl to get instant repli to question and have discuss
quick commun also still can hear someone’ tone read bodi languag
becaus with record video you can go back to it whenev you want to also i would rather have the option for it to be a live class and record it while it’ be taken and then post it so student would go back to it so both actual and i think it’ doabl
i can ask question and particip
better routin and exact schedul
i can speed up the video
becaus it make it easier and we cant get distract
you get to plan your own schedul thi way
it motiv you to actual pay attent becaus if you don’t you can’t see it again becaus it’ live
as we have cover everyth that should have been taught for the final exam the onli thing need now is revis so live class now have littl use wherea solv past paper and revis exercis and send them via email is more help
closest thing to actual real life class
i can decid when to watch the lectur and i‘m good at actual get up and do that without too much procrastin it make me a lot more flexibl and i can make sure i‘m actual abl to focu when i do sit down for the lectur also doesn‘t make me as anxiou as attend live class
becaus alot of cours conven had to transit quickli to onlin learn the zoom discuss are clunki and technolog hasnt been work that well i can complet onlin record lectur at my own pace stop to take note and rewind there less pressur to understand someth straight away you can digest the inform befor move on
i believ speak in front of 50 peopl is a barrier to particip even onlin discuss board imo allow for more nuanc and construct discuss and by extens learn as peopl have the opportun to reflect and retyp befor they press submit
i can learn at my own pace
becaus we can feedback and ask question immedi
interact with teacher and other student are necessari to develop one understand of a topic
we get to have a realtim respons and way more feedback is case there inform lost within the commun
easi to follow most like the normal class in school
mixtur of live and record class
more face to face interact
easier to go at my own pace
becaus i like to work alon and most of the time the teacher onli confus me
connect convers engag learn
it better than record lectur wherebi i am abl to activ learn and ask if i am lost or am not abl to understand someth but in realiti i dont realli ask question and so i just usual just listen to other who have question while also hope other have similar question as mine ultim though im not a big fan of onlin school
becaus i can move in the pace that i want to with record lectur or video i can paus rewind and take my time with section i have troubl understand in live session there are often mani commun issu and i tend to get lost in lectur veri easili and the professor dont have time to explain again or dont even bother check if we have understood
interact learn
the class when conduct live are usual alway in a fix time slowpac and requir engag of everi student in the call if the class are conduct via record lectur i would be abl to studi at my adequ time without ani disturb such as call lag and slow pace i would also be abl to go back and rewatch the lectur if necessari which is not possibl when the class are live
don’t feel comfort on video call
i would actual prefer a combin of live class and uploadedemail materi becaus i feel like i get the most out of live class when we engag in question togeth and upload materi would be use to refer and do selfrevis on
it’ the most similar one to real class we get to ask question and take note simultan get to see everyon and have discuss
give me more freedom to alloc my time to area which i need more attent in
actual get to see other peopl
you can watch it ani time
you can paus it at anytim to take note
forc me to actual do the work
actual my class are live but it record so we can watch the lectur again and it great becaus i can rewatch the part that i dont understand
i felt that i learnt the most that way and it kept it more interact and interest
you don’t get sloppi you actual do the work cuz you have someon watch you all the time
the teacher is abl to go through slide explain content and ask us question as hesh would in a normal classroom environ
i can take note easier and break down what the teacher is say for myself
becaus it is more engag than just do the materi on your own without discuss it later
becaus live class forc me to stay on top of my work and keep me motiv while also give me a routin and a schedul we have to follow
most flexibl can use the resourc how ever i want self direct
i think too quickli for them to speak soooo slooow so i like to speed up the lectur and onli stop them when i need to if i then have ani question or want to start a discuss i can beacaus we have special class about half an hour long to do so after complet a lectur for me thi is the case with onli one class but i wish we had more class like thi
so i can take my time and organ my work
i can directli engag with the class in real time

i can go on my own pace
all our cours are 23 zoom lectur and 13 record lectur i prefer record lectur becaus i have the abil to paus at ani given time work out ani question and research aittl bit on the discuss topic it give me the opportun to realli understand the materi at the day of the lectur which is dure my normal uni routin just not the case
until it wa exam season everyth wa great we had love and understand onlin class so that wa actual pretti ok it realli felt like a normal class we could even take note and in some class we had a good relationship with the teacher
there is more interact between student and the teacher and we can ask question as the lectur goe along
becaus i can stop at anytim i want in order to listen to it again and take note some subject are realli complex and i rememb not be abl to follow if we had lectur live
i’m a visual learner and i can do the work at my own pace fit it in my time schedul
i would be abl to grasp the i format more as i could help relat it to someth
becaus you’r abl to ask question
i still get the feel of be taught someth worthi of the cost without the interrupt of technic difficultiesoth peopl
it more intens do the materi alon and by far not so time consum and if you have question you can still alway ask book parent or teacher
easier to interact and ask question and also i can see peopl from my class
becaus you can paus the video to think more about the subject if you dont understand it and skip the part that may seem bore
somewhat give a sens of normal no guess know that everyon is listen to the lectur at the same time as usual nwjen lectur were in lectur hsll
so i can view it at my own time
i feel as though it is as similar as you can get to in class learn while i have a similar experi in a zoom call the main differ i find is that not a lot of peopl are truli there to learn when we’r on zoom
it’ a live situat where you can ask question and interact with the professor and other student
allow me to studi at my own pace and in my own way
video call alway go on eay linger than they need to discuss forum are a less effici way of learn inform and i prefer learn from text to learn from audio or video
i found learn in some form of face to face contactl conversationsbuild off each other’ idea more engag
we can interact more with the teacher and if we have doubt we can simpli talk right at the moment and got our answer as well it made me feel like stay in a classroom as well
easier to rewind and catch certain thing the teacher may have said that i didn’t catch befor
i can interact with it at my own pace so it make it easier to integr studi into my dail life it doesnt drain my energi as much as zoom class do but it still feel more person than just be provid with materi and have no human connect
the interact and engag with prof and other student make a huge differ
i am tire of watch a screen and i am start to have headach
interact with the teacher and classmat
it’ more interact
it the onli one we tri
i get to see peopl from my class rather than just messag them
i get all the necessari inform deliv to me in one format and i can paus and go back if i miss someth
you can paus the video if they are talk to fast we also have a discuss forum if we have question
live class are the most similar to in person class and requir particip and engag make it more benefici
becaus i can avail record lectur anytim i want
i like the interrsct
it ensur that there are no glitch due to internet issu can be use whenev the student want and it allow me to rewind if i miss someth or zone out which happen a lot due to be in a home environ
becaus it give me the opportun to work by my own schedul and to rewatch thing i didnt understand
it keep me up with the routin of studi
although onlin class forc you to attend the class and you cannot postpon and procrastin on them like you would if it wa a record video record video help you come back to them whenev you need help you can rewatch them as mani time as you want and repeat the part you don’t understand you can also come back to them if you forgot a class you took a long time ago
i actual learn the content and my tutor are amaz i love listen to their stori
interact
i like interact with other peopl
becaus it imit the feel of be in class
it essenti like go to a live lectur so it still enabl us as student to ask question as they come up it think it is the most engag form of onlin learn that they could provid us with
discuss are more focus on understand and appli what we have learn it help put what you are expect to know in perspect and promot critic think and analysi
zoom
becaus you can ask directli question if you don’t understand someth also it keep you account
it would give me a lesson like experi but with no one to talk me through the materi right now i am struggl so would prefer live class
thi way we could have more interact with the professor and other student i miss discuss differ topic
it the closest to tradit lectur which are interact someth that alway nice
work can be done in my own time and at my own pace
the upload materi are actual quit structur and we alway have a number of question we are suppos to be abl to answer after we work with the materi often a video is includ as well and we have weekli test ungrad to check our knowledg
it provid the most effect contact as i can as question and present my work for feedback with a quick respons time studi architectur
i’m stude danc there is no good option but at live meet teacher can give us some kind of correct also we have to record a lot of our homework and in the live class we get feedback
i learn better by myself read it up and teach it myself never use to go to lectur anyway
video can be super inform and can be watch whenev
thi is the onli thing my school is use so i don’t know if other method would be more help
most similar to a normal class structur
i can utilis the materi at my own pace and take break whenev i need to easier to take note as well
interact
i can teach myself in my own time it’ like buy a cours and manag my work on my own
everybodi can work in their own way but we can ask everi question through our school email portal
you can interact with your teacher instantli
then you can ask question etc
i can choos when i watch it i can plan
i would rather have the live aspect of talk to a teacher and see peopl in person as much as possibl when it all prerecord you cant do that
ani question about the session can be answer immedi
for me it most resembl my experi in an actual classroom
it allow me to understand better and go back to what the professor said unlik in onlin class
it help me understand faster and i can ask question on the spot
you can work at your own pace and you don’t have to worri about peopl see you on zoom
it allow for interact discuss and face to face commun which feel more benefici to me
i can do it at my own time and paus whenev i need to
i can do it in my own time and feel more organ than schedul zoom meet with uncertain time
although the live class are anxieti induc and it doesn’t matter how mani i do i’m still afraid of click onto them they are far more engag than a simpl email and help me get engag with my learn and work better than if i wa thrown into the deep end all alon
you can ask question easili and keep in touch with the teacher thi doe not work with for instanc email materi
it is much easier and clearer to understand when a teacher verbal walk you through a topic
it is more interact
as it forc me to remain concentr while i would procrastin studi when use other mode
becaus it motiv me more
it is more interact so i am more engag and concentr pre record lectur are less engag and don’t help to teach me concept
it is easier for me to clarifi ani doubt that i have on the spot without have to contact my teacher separ outsid of class time
becaus i work more effici that way and i’m allow to work at my own pace
i can work through the materi in my own time
i am abl to activ engag with the content
i feel like i can paus the video and repeat it as much as i want to understand a certain point
easier
it’ make me feel more “in class” and focus as it’ happen live i get the opportun to interact with my classmat ask question etc it just feel like the closest to a normal class at uni
becaus i can choos when i want to do it so i am more flexibl to plan my day i can also rewatch part that i don’t understand
interact
becaus of the opportun for actual live interact
there’ a real time interact element with tutor especi with a facetofac option
i can skip or fast forward through part that are too slow and i can paus the record if i feel like i didnt fulli understand someth to tri to understand it better i can also start and stop the class whenev i like
i am abl to ask question to my teacher directli when i have queri
can ask question live and see human which is kinda nice too
it give me the time i need and i can alway watch it back multipl time live class are help to keep a schedul but they also depend highli on time and technic stuff like wifi connect which is not the best
i can ask question right away
becaus i studi theatr and the onli proper way to have onlin cours is live class
the rang of my cours is realli wide so for scienc like mathemat and physic i actual prefer record lectur but for cours like english or art histori i actual prefer live class
well my faculti function differ from other faculti howev with thi option we can access the video anytim and alway rewatch it if we’v miss anyth importantmisunderstand someth it give us the option to go back an understand it again if we want to
becaus of the abil to engag with the materi it less of a haasl to ask question and have the teacher explain thing live make it easier to grasp it also easier to focu and it nice see my teacher
i can watch the lectur again if i realli need to i can also do it at my own time and schedul it in between all my assign
it give you a chanc to ask about anyth you don’t understand video chat often ha mani peopl talk at the same time
it wa simpli easier to work at my own pace with upload materi
regular seminar
there is more interact and it is possibl to ask questionsparticip
the most interact out of those choic closest to the system we had befor
i can acceler or pass the part that im not interest in or go back if i need to listen again to somet more complic
you can get a better and immedi feedback on your understand of assign text also the convers is more fluent and in gener more interest
more engag requir
it is interact in natur
i can paus and rewatch
zoom
easier to speed up and listen to
more confid x
the abil to gain a better understand of confus topic
closest thing to a real lectur you can ask question and here answer to other people’ question thi is not the case when we independ go through the materi and email in question it is also easier to get distract and not stay on track without live event
it’ not a wast of time a lot of my live class were useless
i actual have time structur into my day in a mandatori manner
abil to ask question as the content is explain mean i can have a deeper understand of the topic
it feel like an actual lesson at school u can talk to the professor directli and ask question
help the student interact with other student and instructor on a real time basi and verbal discuss tend to be of higher qualiti
becaus it allow me to follow the cours whenev i want and becaus i prefer listen to teacher instead of read a entir cours by myself for the first time i also like ondin live class a lot
it with more vari and less bore
i dont have to keep up with my teacher and classmat in live class i can read them whenev i want
be held account intetact
it‘ help to get advic directli from the lectur and it‘ just nice to be abl to see everyon and i like that the lectur ha got the opportun to be more spontan about how he’ organ the way we learn about certain topic concern how the group is interest in how well the group ha understood the topic
mire flexibl
i learn better from listen to somebodi teach in person rather than work set onlin
i rare discuss assing with my teacher
we can ask question and gain a better understand about the topic that are be discuss
i can organ my work when i want
actual attend lectur and tutori in real life
abl to studi ani time of the day
it is my prefer mode becaus most of our instructor dont use live class and if they do use them it is mostli not help becaus we are just go over materi that we have been send with send materi i can work by my own pace and if i am interest in someth i can research it in normal class we dont have time for that
i think thi is more interact and doubt can be clarifi on the spot
i prefer the combin of record lectur and discuss forum becaus the first make understand the task and the second make you soak into the task and tackl your creativ and your idea about it
abl to go through everyth at my own speed plu i’m take a btec cours so i’m assess through cours work present so it’ easier to refer back to than a zoom class
abil to paus to take a break research etc flexibl to studi whenev
feel more present and like i’m there
it is asynchron and give me a lot of flexibl plu i hear what the professor ha to say about the subject
difficult thing in lectur note usual explain
i can paus the lectur ani time i can listen to it twice
it is similar to be in school
i can go through materi at my own pace which increas my understand of the topic a lot more
becaus it would allow me to have more flexibl regard time manag and i would be abl to stop and replay it whenev i need to
you can directli ask question
free time manag
teacher explain the work
as the teacher can clarifi on thing we did not realli understand
use to go through at your own pace
get a chanc to engag and allow for preread to be complet along the way as well also a good social aspect which encourag think and allow student to engag more with topic at hand
you can rewatch them at ani time
i can watch them at my own pace
it keep me account for my progress and work when i feel like procrastin becaus i’d get into troubl with my teacher otherwis
more engag and i’m more motiv to do the work
i think have contact with my peer and lectur is sooo import to learn it’ more engag and motiv than just watch a prerecord video
i think that conduct self research and analyz it is more effect than listen to someon even a teacher under the curent circumst
you can plan by yourself what to do when and you can adapt the speed the way you want it
becaus it forc me to take note and stay focus when class are live and if i have ani connect problem it is veri hard to stay focus as i cannot here the teacher properli
i like that i can watch the lectur in my own time
becaus i like the flexibl of watch record lectur and the rest i could do on my own
i’m happi to see everyon it’ almost like in school
interact and although not entir social
you get the most feedback and support
i feel like a get the most from it
becaus it allow us to have the interact with the teacher it is easier to ask question and we are more focus
so i can interact with teacher and other student
i am current in a veri differ time zone from my univers so live class have been difficult to keep up with while record lectur i can watch at ani time
can do in my own time flexibl
we can paus the video if we do not understand a concept and can replay it if we need to
the onli way we can commun with professor ask them and answer they question
it is much easier to ask question
help to be abl to talk to teacher in person
it is easier to understand and learn
more interact avail to ask question on the spot
greater sens of normalaci
becaus learn from a powerpoint is not as benefici or easi as be abl to see how the work is complet for subject such as math
becaus i’m directli abl to ask question and becaus it feel a bit more person
there are more interact
you can ask question as you go thing can be clear up through actual attend a class as it harder get distract when it a live session when you watch a record it becom easier to focu on other thing as oppos to watch the lectur which can be paus
becaus it make me feel like i am nit complet on my own even though i find it realli hard to focu
becaus when i am just watch or read passiv i feel like i just want to get the studi over with which is not a purpos of univers when i am at a live lectur i engag activ and i feel excit about learn
i learn easier when someon explain it to me and i can hear them whilst i take note when they teach or speak
i enjoy engag with other to learn and discuss idea and concept and i find it’ easier to get to a deeper level and detail
you can ask question directli and receiv immedi clarif
allow for a more ‘realistic’ classroom set
can ask question live
becaus i can ask my teacher anyth while she or he is lectur
i feel like everyon put more effort into learn materi when be “face to face” and i’v alway been more of interact learner
similar to normal class base learn
i can make my own schedul paus the lesson and go back to it if i want
it would feel more like a normal lectur and be more interact
i can manag my time better
it nice to be abl to paus and rewind if you need to sinc there are so mani more distract at home
becaus i can attend the class whenev i want
i can watch it when i want and not as awkward
becaus it mean you can do the work in your own time lockdown mean i had to chang my schedul and work full time to support my famili so i couldn’t make schedul group video call or meet i prefer the teach on site such as futur learn where you can work through the materi at your own pace perhap with deadlin on what you do each week
most compar to a normal school lesson
ask your teacher for help is more access and it feel more person
it give you the chanc to have an open debat and you can interact with the teacher the best in my opinion
it give me time to work through it
it possibl to ask question as they come up
i prefer thi method as my lectur put a lot of detail and key inform
zoom give me anxieti
it provid the closest substitut to a classroom experi with realtim engag
i am engag it’ fun i’m not just sit in a room listen for 8 hour
dure live class the lectur still explain the materi and im abl to ask directli if i dont understand what wa be explain
easier
you learn togeth with all of the brother and not alon
i can stop and replay it if i need time to process inform
there is some interact with the teacher which i find easier to follow as well as question from other student realli help me in my learn process
zoom ha poor connect
more engag
i’m mainli a visual and auditori learner therefor the zoom class mean that for the most part i don’t have to teach myself the cours independ
more dinam doe not let them explain more that they would in a normal class
the teacher can explain the work and take feedbackansw question instead of set work which at the moment is copi from a textbook
i can go through it at my own pace
it the most engag other than live class we onli have email materi and most of the time it is hard to find motiv for do it sinc we dont realli discuss the result
at least i have some interact with my group mate and professor
interact
we can understand everyth from peoffesor directli and can ask them anyth we didnot understand
becaus i think it is most disciplin way of onlin class as we cannot postpon it and end up never take class
becaus ill be free to schedul my time
it’ easier to ask for help when the cours is live and also they are at the same time as regular class would be so it help with keep some sort of routin while stay at home
facetofac interact
i learn best from lectur note i do appli math
i can learn and watch the lectur at my own speed
interact
it realli difficult to learn a level in scienc without be abl to ask wuestion and have topic explain face to face
i can take my time complet assign
im abl to be more product when i can just read the assign the class take a long time look at the inform be told i get it after 10 minut
easier to understand stuff that is explain via video rather than just powerpoint slide upload without them be talk through
i don’t get distract with the call and see my friend on video
i need to hear it to understand it better
it is more time manag and it give the opportun to go back to topic in the lectur that i did not understand
help me maintain a routin and it feel more like normal lectur
i
question can be ask there and now
i can choos when to do work and i read definit faster than a teacher can explain sth in a video or such
it most like a normal lesson
so that i can look back and take note howev live is good to ask question and such
to be fair it is the onli method we have use we have had a coupl upload powerpoint file with voiceov for the practic part of one of my cours but that onli last for about a month while they were figur out how to make those lesson live as well our live lesson are also record though so theyr avail to watch if need be
it’ just the closest to an actual lectur
becaus i can learn on my own
instant feedback
feel more like an actual lesson
zoom
it make learn activ an engag
becaus i can watch it at my own time be abl to take note as i go and dont feel pressur to understand everyth in the first explen
becaus it is the most effect one where it feel like a real lectureseminar though it most often doesnt
becaus a live class is the most close you can get to have a physic class in person none of my teacher have ever done a live class but from what ive heard it is the most engag and effect mode of onlin teach
i can watch them at ani time of the day not onli at a set time for live class and they are more enjoy and easier to understand than plain materi sent by an email
i like when instructor trust us and simpli send their cours by email or put them on a share platform it way less difficult and exhaust than when they organis live class or discuss forum where it often badli organis internet access problem for some
allow me to have a lot of interact with my teacher and also the other student in my class so we can collabor
becaus it allow me to dive deep into a topic and focu on the particular part i am most interest in without somebodi affect my schedul and work environ
it’ just easier to get done and live class are so glitchi and half the time i don’t even know what is go on
the cours cant be ani longer than normal and it is live so you see the professor fellow student it is the most activ version of onlin teach
becaus you can ask question directli
can access at ani time then dont feel bad about miss a live one
the content can be explain thoroughli by a lectur so that we understand it and we can set up our own studi schedul to accommod our home schedul
feel more like an actual lesson there no confus regard the task and actual get taught and stay more to schedul
the interact natur allow the facilit of question and dialogu with other member of the class which assist activ learn
you can take it at your own pace but it is still explain
more convini and mean i’m not wake up at 9am to see some 40 year old crusti man with obviou home issu due to the constant scream in hi hous and hi son blatant disregard for hi work it’ offici kid are dick and chemist are beta 🥺
we have captur lectur today but i find the relationship with my lectur here more distant when i’m zoom with my other coursem and with small talk befor with question after there feel to be a converg of the group
becaus it feel more like real class
in india there are mani place which do not have access to the internet for ex jammu and kashmir onlin class which are conduct on platform such as zoom happen at a certain time what if a student ha a realli poor connect to the internet while the class is be conduct they miss out on it thi is whi i prefer discuss forumschat over other mode becaus it store inform for a time when the student would be abl to have access to the internet i am anyway against onlin learn becaus it exclud mani student who do not come from veri privileg background but discuss on chat can still be use to make it all a littl more inclus
can replay the videosrecord when need no pressur to particip live on zoom
most like a ‘normal’ class allow for debatediscuss easier to ask question etc
live
you can see and interact with the teacher
it is easier to manag workload and you get to work at your own pace
i tend to go slow when get new info so i usual paus and go back on the video simultan i make note for thing i didnt get so i can ask the professor by e mail or chat
you can make note and get inform in your own time and with a teacher’ knowledg which is better than just textbook work but you don’t have the awkward of a live zoom call where more time is wast and you can’t get the note down as easili
my attent will be better sinc i can choos the moment of studi myself
i like the interact
it is flexibl as it allow you to paus rewatch etc i think interact with lectur is import though so we have discuss board that follow these up or the occasion zoom discuss to allow thing to be reexplain or to ask question i feel like thi compens for that lack of interact from pre record lectur
you can consult back to the materi and it provid flexibl for studi time
easi to paus or repeat someth make my schedul flexibl
i have the freedom to decid when i studi specif materi as noth is schedul by my teacher so nobodi is reli on my presenc
open a discuss after read the materi for the lectur make you ask better effici question at the lectur than when it a live lectur
becaus i can schedul my day myself
easier time wise and travel i also love independ learn
becaus it work great for me so far
interact
the social aspect
becaus you can paus at anytim if you dont understand and can go at your own pace
becaus i can interact with the professor
interact
watch record lectur and then have a live discuss is much more effici than have the full lectur live
it enabl me to watch the lectur paus it and make more detail note than if i wa in a live lectur
record lectur
it allow me to absorb the info at my own pace without rush or need the teacher go reexplain
becaus in thi way i am more flexibl and abl to go back to the lectur later on if need be
i am abbl to understand better the concept than just by an email
it’ the most understand
can engag with content and ask question
interact without the pressur of be live
i can listen the lectur whenev i want i can manag my time
i get to work through it at my own pace
becaus you can interact with the teacher
from a social aspect it feel more facetofac and from an academ aspect it definit help to stay motiv and focus
can schedul the workload in my own time
it is more interact
i can do it whenev i want
it is more like usual lesson
easiest
you cannot back out or give up
it is faster than record lesson and we can also have a proper discuss with teacher
becuas it the onli one we have had so far
becaus i feel with a teacher and the class there i understand thing a lot quicker and i learn thing that i don’t when i studi by myself it also mean that i have to do the work i’m not just have to self motiv
it’ more interact you can ask question discuss with class member
i am abl to work independ and at my own pace and view the work befor class to prepar
more interact and engag
i can stop and rewind
it at least ha some form of face to face contact
easier to engag with teacher and other student without have to be on video or talk when my joke environ make video lesson difficult
becaus you still get some interact with the professor as you would if the class were “physical”
you can take your time and made some research at your own pace
it make me feel like part of the commun again it can be isol just watch lectur
live class
couldnt add thi kind of respons but record lectur and video with the professor be avail in a zoom call dure the time the actual lectur would be happen whi the video let us student paus repeat play the video in differ speed we can watch the video whenev and as often as we want and a live zoom qa session about the last video with the profinstructor dure the lectur slot ive us the chanc to realli understand the materi
you can rewatch the video at my school you can often do your own homework instead of listen to the teacher but in live onlin class you are often oblig to particip with record lectur you can work at your own pace
i prefer learn on my own and not in a class set which i would have had to face with thing like zoom it also allow me to complet task on my own time instead of have to conform to class time
everyth is clarifi so you dont miss understand anyth
allow us to be taught by our teacher properli while be flexibl around home life as you can watch whenev
i feel more connect and engag to the work and it not onli make it more interest to interact with peopl but it is a good way of socialis dure thi current time
it give you the opportun to share idea with the group and ask tutor question as they come up
i like have record lectur in conjunct with discuss board and chat to compar with my peer as to how i’v perceiv the content i can therefor add in others’ idea to my note that i may not have initi thought about
you can speed up the process if the professor is talk too slow
from my experi with other onlin class record lectur is prefer bc the lectur are the closest thing to an inperson class which is where i do better in learn
less pressur becaus you don’t have to talk directli to your lectur in front of your class on for exampl zoom
i like hear from my teacher and be abl to ask them to explain someth in a differ way
becaus i can go at my own pace will still be taught by an accual teacher
you get to keep your day to day structur when you have to attend a lectur on time
more interact easier to learn and understand
becaus we can interact
you get to interact with your mate and the teacher as if it wa a normal school day kind of
it’ a lot more engag
it make my schedul realli flexibl and i can rewatch the materi
you can ask a question immedi when you don’t understand someth and get an answer on the spot it’ easier and moreno dynam
i can watch them whenev i want and i can take break whenev i want
it is easier to adjust to my schedul as oppos to onlin lectur meet
it would be nice to be taught the materi instead of teach myself
provid there are less than normal lesson it mean i can see my teacher face to face have class discuss and ask question directli but if i had as mani live lesson as if i wa in school i would hate it i have one a week for each teacher so 8 live lesson a week and the rest is independ work which in mani way im quit suit to especi im creativ art
it is easier to explain your question in a live chat than tri to type them on a chat becaus sometim what you are stuck on get misinterpret have a live lesson is also a bit more like a normal lesson and it’ nice to be abl to see other peopl who are not in your hous
it’ allow you to engag with other student and your lectur more and gain a deeper understand of the cours materi
allow me to write up lectur note and i learn the best visual
although i get lazi and unmotiv to watch them sometim i can paus the video and take note analyz and understand as mani time as i need to i could not do thi with live zoom meet i thrive with onlin class
becaus i can alway come back to it
it’ more social
becaus it forc you to engag and is self contain to a specif time which help separ school work from the rest of life
more interact
becaus it somewhat engag and make it easier for me to maintain structur as well as some level of facetofac contact
i find it is the best way for me to learn materi
it help with understand and question can be answer inmedi
you get to learn from your own teacher rather than be set work from a websit
i can work through the set materi at my own pace take detail note and take time to understand the content that i am learn i can also go back over the work if i am stuck and need a deeper understand
becaus it enabl you to discuss topic for a deeper understand of the cours materi and hold you account for do the work uni requir you to do
becaus it stimul the same environ we are use to when we are physic in class
becaus it is comfort for me
becaus we can ask question in real time and it’ more one to one it also make the onlin learn aspect seem less stranger and more normal
i have no motiv if it’ live all our camera are turn of so no one can actual keep an eye on us
easier to ask question and would give me more motiv
you can rewatch the leuctur for anyth you miss and isn’t as full on as a normal class
more interact
becaus i can get the work complet at my own pace
becaus then you feel yourself as if you all are unit again and you can compet and show your knowledg and ask question right away
you can ask question duringaft
it give us the abil to ask question and engag more with the class also have it life make it easier to not procrastin sinc there’ a set time for class
becaus there is more interact with the instructor and the other student and it increas your motiv to studi
allow interact
you can directli talk to the teacher
i prefer live class as student can easili commun with teacher and easili understand concept sinc teacher are devot time to make sure student understand the topic be taught
feel the most like a normal lesson
i prefer live class becaus they resembl the normal class that we had befor lockdown the most
interact and much quicker it is happen ‘real time’
i can do thing at my own pace
becaus i can alway ask some question on a materi
i have found it use for teacher interact although we do have some onlin class there aren’t load and i think it can be hard if we’r just given sheet to work through on googl classroom
becaus it’ the most simliar to the normal system and you can get a real time interact with your professor and also it is grat to conduct discuss
interact
it the closest to normal class
it more practic you can also right away ask your instructor about anyth you dont understand
forc work and can check understand
i can watch them when i have time which is realli conveni i can also watch them over and over until i have realli unterstood what the professor said gener i find it difficult to speak in real time class as the teach languag of my master is not my mother tongu
interact
it is more engag
it’ easier to be in contact virtual with your teacher you understand better and you can ask them question easili
it allow me to studi at my own pace and review when i need to live lesson via zoom wasn’t the best for me caus i wa easili distract and would often find myself zone out
becaus you can at least have some kind of visibl human interact wherea with upload or email materi you are onli given an assig without have a discuss
the interact help me learn and when im forc to take part at a specif time im more like to do the work prepar for the class
more interact so i can as question make me concentr more so i becom more focus
i find onlin class veri stress with most teacher and so i like be set work with deadlin
it ha more interact it make me feel like i’m actual attend uni
you can paus the video to keep up with note take you can rewatch a section of the video if you couldnt make out what they were say the first time you can go at your own pace
becaus you can paus and take your time do it
becaus i can go through it at my own pace and my teacher understand that
it give the opportun to respond and it make that the professor speak in a more human way instead of realli quickli and robot robot in their prerecord lectur i also get to see my classmat and friend and hear them speak which ha been a realli long time
more engag rather than just a piec of paper etc abil to ask question and thing are explain in more detail
i don’t have to talk to anyon unnecessarili i can just get the work done independ
abil to ask question and listen to other question you might not have thought of
better understand of work and better commun with the teacher
it’ more like what it would be like normal if we went to school
teacher is abl to explain content you’r not rope learn anyth
teacher usual rush to finish their topic and thu we cant realli grasp it enough to ask them questionsif they make the video take their own time we can learn from it and ask them about our doubt through googl classroom or through mail
discuss board allow for time differ but also peer interact i like record lectur but the lack of peer bother me
it is more interact and it is verbal explain which i understand more than read it myself
more interact can consolid knowledg
it is easier to understand the content as teacher are abl to explain the topic as if we were in class without the disrupt of mutter or other student rude cut in
for my languag part of the cours i prefer zoom class as it can be more interact it is the same for seminar howev i don’t mind record lectur for the busi part of my degre
i can watch it whenev i want i can also paus and go back if i miss someth
there is someth veri intimid about video call you also have to deal with privaci issu with call and you have to inconveni your famili a forum would be much easier
i am a music student and thi is the medium that allow me to get close to what it would feel like to perform in front of a class
can do it in my own time
easi and you can plan your studi time
as you can interact with your lectur and is more social it nice to see everyon whilst be isol
live class allow a better interact between the teacher and the student which you dont get in record lectur
i miss the social aspect of learn and i believ teacher can explain better the materi through live video connect rather than through a written text
can get live feedback
i have a side hustl and record class allow me to schedul studi on time i want dure the day
make you feel like your still at uni and your still part of a cohort not just on your own studi
the combin of audio and visual keep me focus more than just the visual it’ much easier to watch a video start to finish without paus and walk away for me than to do a list of task without get distract
interact instant repli to question
i feel like i would be quit anxiou to attend some of the more interact mode of teach
you can ask question and be more interact
i can watch it when i have the time
more engag and like actual be at univers lectur
it’ the method that keep me most account and engag
it the closest to actual seminar
nice to have interact easier to ask question receiv clearer and more detail explan of topic
easier to move through and not get distract
allow me to studi effect in my own time becaus i am a key worker so i am do extra hour dure ‘school’
becaus i can ask question and particip in discuss
zoom confer
tbh it’ becaus i can see my friend and it’ what feel most like an actual cours
it depend on the format of my assign and what i am tri to learn
i like to be abl to go back and watch someth again
it still give the inform you need but it doesn’t depend on a good internet connect for everybodi so you can actual hear everyth that’ be told
i can paus to catch up or replay what i didnt understand without have a panic of miss ani import inform
to engag with other student
becaus i can ask and get the answer instantli
easier to ask question and gain an instant respons rather than wait on an email back etc
becaus then i actual feel oblig to attend wherea i dont feel motiv to look at ani of the record lectur
interact and discuss base
it is closest to „normal“ univers convers are possibl and you can ask question as they aris
it’ at a pace you can follow easili if it’ prerecord some of my class are it can be much harder to understand as you can’t ask question and it can’t be rephras or explain in more detail
in live class you can ask question if you dont understand someth
i find that i am far more engag and the teacher can go into depth wherea with upload materi it may requir ask for help via email
i like be abl to ask question when i do not get the materi
it’ interact and come closest to analog learn
i can go back to the materi whenev i want to and feel free to ask ani question later
i prefer record lectur becaus thi allow me to go through the materi at my own pace and to come back to it when necessari i engag better when i hear my instructor discuss the materi when i have to do it alon i tend to get lost and lose focu
see and listen to the teacher make me understand the content the best that way i’m abl to particip in the lesson speak for myself and listen to other students’ idea
time to watch is more flexibl
you can do the work in your own time and fit it around other thing
becaus i can studi in my own speed
more interact and abl to get help when stuck
you get more work done and get all the info you need
becaus we can ask the teacher question in real time
account i often let lectur pile up until the night befor an exam and that wa not good for my grade
all the work is set out clearli for the day and if further assist in requir you could alway email the teacher
you can do it when you feel readi
i find it hard to stay focus for a whole onlin lectur on zoom for exampl for that i believ that record lectur are the best option for me not onli becaus i can understand the lectur and take note but becaus it alway me to have a sens of control of what i’m do more time and more option
i like see my tutor it give a sens of normal
record lectur still give guidanc but on your own time and you can rewatchgo back
becaus it give me the chanc to do assign and and listen to class when i feel motiv
give a chanc for discuss and to ask question
i can paus or repeat record lectur sometim the pace of onlin lectur is too slow for me and i get bore easili but record lectur give me the opportun to speed up the tempo or to repeat certain extract
it is one on one help learn better most similar to an actual class
can access in my own time can paus and stop to make note as i go along and can googl and do bit on more depth when it’ paus
so that i can be in control of when i want to do school and i dont have to follow a timet
just make the lesson quicker realli i can email my teacher for question or text them
more like a real lectur and you can ask question there and then
you are abl to work at your own pace
it’ engag and i can ask question on the spot if i have ani
i feel like thi show the lectur care more and make me feel more engag
can watch thing on my time easier to fit into a schedul also nice to watch lectur in bed
it is the most engag
teacher can answer our question live feel like a normal class
more person and clear
there is more interact and it feel the most similar to normal inperson class
live interact with the teacher and can ask question at the same time
it is too difficult to have discuss without visual bodi languag queue irl
although onlin we are still abl to engag with one anoth through real time chat
it just make it easier the work is there readi to go and if you have question you can googl meet if you need to
i can go at my own pace
can paus video and will help catch up
there‘ a fix schedul and you‘r abl to interact with the lectur and other particip
i find it most engag and enjoy
becaus it is most similar to physic lectur
beacus it is better for teacher to explain us the theme we are do beacus i got use to it in school
more interact
becaus there’ an immedi respons when you ask a question
so i can do it in a conveni amount of time take longer or shorter if i need to
you get more help
the abil to ask question about the content or get thing clarifi almost immedi
feel most similar to face to face class
i have one teacher who use loom to talk through the lesson content and that help me to gain a deeper understand than a worksheet would especi as thi is my german teacher it is veri help
it allow for more interact

you feel like you are still somewhat in a class and you maintain a rough routin becaus you still have schedul time for class you have to attend
i find it easier to do my own thing
becaus it enabl discuss to take place and encourag me to ask question straight away
i find it easier to understand the lesson when my teacher explain by talk through it instead of explain it through a powerpoint
becaus we can ask teacher question too and not just sit there and listen if we don’t understand someth
help to understand the topic more in depth
you can paus and rewind the video if you miss someth import or to catch up on note
i get the content explain rather than teach it to myself and it feel more like a normal classroom but i can do the lesson whenev i want becaus it’ record
i can watch and go back on the record and it avail whenev i want to listen to it
i learn better with face to face commun
it veri easi to go back on stuff if you didnt understand anyth
i like to have the option to ask question live like in a classroom
my class doesn’t engag well onlin
more engag and feel more like normal class while record lectur feel like i’m teach myself complet
i enjoy be abl to watch at my pace and rewatch section which cant be done in live class due to a larg class number it is hard to ask question in the the live class
it closer to offlin learn mean it more involv
more interact
it’ the onli one i’v use
it’ easier to organ my time and to be effici moreov live class are just too long and unproduct
not as much pressur as live lesson
so that we can commun with each other and discuss on topic in real time
feel like the lesson but without the awkward and time restrict of live chat
as an engin student it make more sens to go through and understand the content at my own pace while do question
resembl real class
ha teacher interact and explan of content which is realli help but allow more flexibl for when it is done dure the day unlik live class
i can take as much time to cover the content as i need

i’m at bovt do an actor train and follow thi type of class then record myself and send it back to my tutor allow them to be as specif as they are in the room when tri to correct 14 student over zoom it get veri vagu
it for me the most effect way of learn where i can choos myself what i have to work on more intens in live class eg zoom it happen often that the teacher use a lot of time to speak about thing i alreadi know and that are not relev for me therefor i often stop listen care and it is wast time for me howev zoom class are great for issu that are more difficult to understand or for foreign languag that one have to practic and speak frequent
all the inform is there in front of you
more interact and engag with our teacher and our materi
it use to be abl to ask question but thi is onli good if it also record incas you miss itar in a differ time zone etc

i can work at the time and pace i like
abl to watch back and take note

becaus onli half of my teacher actual teach on the live class and i end up use the resourc upload anyway
i miss be abl to have contact with peopl on my cours and be abl to share idea
becaus it is easi to follow and also learn and a other point is that the teacher could see who is talk part and who is not if one for exampl get exercis send to via email or chat one would have to learn it for themselv which is not easi for everyon
less stress can be done at ani time
becaus i’v alway learn better when i’v had someon talk to me and been interact

the work can be done at my own pace therefor more freetim
it allow for greater flexibl and autonomi
i get my own time to understand it and go back on it rather than on a zoom you onli hear it onc and the teacher just want to fli through it
easier to engag
allow me to engag at my own pace
it’ interact we could discuss idea and build on them
i like to still have the design time by the univers to be in front of the comput for my session i like live class also becaus you can take your doubt at the exact time you are learn
to give me ambienc of learn
we haven’t had the choic of anyth els so i don’t know what els i would prefer
get more out of the lesson
can interact live if you don’t understand someth you can post a comment and the tutor will repli there and then rather than have to wait for a respons
the content doe into my brain so much easier than if i’m read it from a screen but there’ no faff from meet at a certain time and go on a live zoom
we can ask our doubt and have live discuss
you can work at your own pace
it allow for direct contact with the teacher to ask question and it is more engag as so you kind of propel to listen
it’ great if the lectur are live becaus it motiv you to get up if it’ an earli one also if i have ani question i don’t need to email my lectur i can just ask it in the chat
i can organ my time as i want to be more product
becaus in my univers we use someth call pbl and dure tutori the discuss is mainli entertain by the student meet on onlin platform live make it feel more like we are still in a room togeth and it’ easi to still enjoy debat
actual hear peopl explain it is better becaus i struggl to read that amount of unexplain inform

becaus it give you the space to work on thing at you own scedul it also give a nice overview of all your assign
becaus the teacher can actual teacher you and you dont have to teach all the content to yourself
ive never tri it but i reckon it would come closer to emul the normal classroom atmospher with peopl bounc idea off each other etc
becaus i’m not the most confid so it’ nice to be abl to do the work without seeingtalk to anyon
so i can ask question as they are go through it instead of have to email them afterward with a list of question if the lectur is prerecord
feel more normal
becaus it’ easier to understand the content when the teacher is explain rather than tri to figur it out yourself which take longer
i can learn at my own pace
to have a schedul
becaus it better to have live class where we could ask professor anyth that we did not understand dure the lectur
i find it easier to understand more than read an email or a document
it best simul a real classroom my class are usual small compar to most mayb 10 peopl as i studi languag so have thi simul is realli import it allow realtim question and for us to practic key skill ie spoken languag in a way no other format would
i can go through powerpoint at my own speed and make note and tri question on my own without be held back by other
video call realli slow ani discuss down natur discuss don’t realli occur in the way they should
easier to accesswork around schedul and shift at my parttim job
i enjoy hear the teacher voic and still have structur not entir self direct must go to class so more motiv
you can particip in the learn at your own pace
if you have record video lectur you are abl to chose when to work through them also it’ easier to follow when click “stop” and take some more time to revis the stuff more intens
find live class quit anxieti induc and exhaust i like work on thing in my own time
the concept can be explain in more detail and i find it easier to concentr when i can hear my teacher’ voic
i can work where and when i want to
easier to work at my own pace
i can work at my own pace
it give you time to paus the inform so you can refer back to it live video you sometim don’t get all the inform necessari
it’ most like a in person class
i am free to listen to it when i like and how i like i have dyslexia so be abl to slow a video down realli help live class i can’t learn from they’r cater to a veri specif type of learn i suppos all school is haha
you get to engag with the professor live so you can ask ani burn question there and then befor you forget
thi help me to take my own time to follow a lectur as when i do not understand someth i can easili go back and take more time to understand it it allow me to follow class at my own pace
everyon can contribut like a normal class well mostli also you cann ask lectur question in real time harder to miss a love lectur as you have to commit to join it
becaus you can still ask question and interact as close to how a lesson would normal work
direct interact with student and professor
don’t like talk in front of a larg group of peopl
i feel that zoom call are much to busi as we have larg class our teacher send us the materi which will be use in the lesson and add help video on the topic from youtub for me i feel thi allow me to go through the lesson at the speed which suit me best and give myself time to understand what i need to learn
allow to do when avail instead of have to join the live lectur or call
interact and therefor sustain learn is more encouragedlik
becaus i am a veri interact person i learn by engag with other on differ pov and search for the whi and how it ha highest longterm chanc of stick in my memori
i actual like a mixtur of zoom meet with materi i can look at
it‘ easier to ask question and you don‘t get as distract as with record lectur
more discuss allow smaller class size
you can do it at your own pace
no awkward interact with teacher onlin
still get to engag with supervisor in small group set the most import way if learn at cambridg
becaus it is more similar to the tradit way we follow lesson
a verbal explan of content is easier to understand especi dure onlin learn
i can paus the video and quickli write my note
we get to see the teacher and ask ani question we want and it just easier to understand the topic
i will be abl to make note and gain an understand at my prefer rate and if i have ani question i can drop them in the chat or email the teacher
you can ask question and it just like a real lesson
get to interact with other student and teacher
i learn best through visual learn i find read through note that i dont understand difficult so have note that are read to me while i look through the note or have record lectur would be huge benefici i think
you can directli ask question and get answer instead of wait for a respons everi time
independ work can do it on your own time
it’ the mode that come closest to our regular class one of my class reli sole on a textforum base approach which is not overli motiv the other mainli on live class and they are far more engag i also studi languag which would be veri difficult to do base on onli materi
easier to engag actual have to go to it and have some structur in the day mean that it doesn’t take twice as long to go through the lectur
abl to stop and do when time permit
live class have been realli stress as our teacher continu call out a specif student by name to answer question
i think it’ a better replac of my univers experi befor it went onlin
i’m not nervou from be on dam on videochat and i’m not time limitem to the time of the meet personali i don’t like ani of the onlin version of studi i jist have to surviv it
it allow for direct commun and particip in my learn
you are vale to stop the record or play it back
i dont have to verbal interact i can do thing at my own pace
i can focu better and get the work done faster of cours for some class it better to get to meet with the instructor but overal thi mode is the most effici for me some of the live class can be also a bit stress
it way more easier to understand the lesson when the teacher explain it
allow me to go at my own pace without tech issu
it enabl us to be interact and abil to ask question if need be
interact with other
becaus you can rewatch the video
i can watch in my own time and make note at my own pace
it still similar to be in a classroom as have it taught to me help me rememb content better
no interrupt with internet not work on zoom
it’ easi to follow the materi and good if you have question becaus you get an answer right away
i learn best by listen
becaus it still give me some structur sinc i have to show up on time and it’ also becaus it’ a lot easier to hear the teacher explan especi for subject like math
you can look back and watch them at your own speed if there is a subject which you didn’t fulli understand you can alway watch it again and learn from it becaus you watch it dure your own time you concentr better instead of play with your phone dure the live lectur prior to corona
find independ work easier with lot of resourc
the live class were mainli check in session with group work but nobodi spoke in them or had their camera on so it wa realli awkward and a wast of time howev with record lectur i could listen to what i need to write note and then email lectur if i had ani question
with live class there is still some form of interact between student and with the teacher there is time to catch up a littl befor class and it give me a fix schedul a time when i need to be somewher
more flexibl to when i can complet the work
i quit like a combin of mode howev lot of my teacher spent 60 of the live class tri to figur out how to share screen etc so it wa just veri unproduct wherea with the record option which one of my teacher use in combin with live they were veri structur and plan out plu i could replay them to clarifi thing that i had misunderstood
it allow me to structur my own time amd plan my work then i can get help from my teacher via email without hold up the rest of the class in a live lesson i also prefer selfteach as i work better if i can process thing in my own way
i like have visual stimulu and i can alway refer back topaus inform to take it in at my own pace
could stop the record if they go too fast or if i need to go over someth again
more structur in my day easier to understand
one can ask question and get feedback immedi
instant feedback
flexibl with time
i can take my own time and rewind at ani point i may wish if i didn’t understand or i can play the video in doubl speed if i understand the topic
it allow me to watch the materi on my own tempo i can paus if im distract and watch it later with full attent it also allow me to plan my day of work on my own term
you can control the pace of your own learn and you aren’t tie down to a specif time like a call you still get some level of interact which make learn slightli easier
i understand more on the topic with some explain someth than just read off of a slide although i hunk i might have prefer a zoom call or someth but that wa never an option in my studi
when im home i like to work when i want to ie prefer not at 8 am and most of our class time never fit in the timet i made for myself
becaus it feel closer and more real
can work through in my own time less stress feel the need to pay attent dure onlin class
we can make sure we understood the materi and receiv a more detail explan of the materi we are studi moreov we can benefit from the question and answer of our peer and expand our reason thank to them
it is easier when the content is explain to you
work easier with uncertain schedul
interact can ask qs
becaus even with the materi i need someon to explain the content to me
it is more like a real lesson so you can get more detail input from the teacher more easili
i can watch them whenev i feel most product
you can ask questionsget more help
most engag
i can do the work when i want
allow me to work to my own schedul
veri hard to keep up with the larg workload when everyth is upload at onc some with no record onli lectur slide
you can interract with your professor and ask question directli witout have to wait sever hour for a respond
it is more intens and i have to be present have some type of deadlin also help
most similar to learn in a classroomlesson set
i understand the content best when it is explain to me by someon it is better than just read about it
it nice to do everyth at your own pace
it less confront so it easier for someon to post and question and for other to repli
i can engag with other student learn from and with them
it give you the freedom and time to work whenev you have chanc
becaus in a way you can still spend time with your classmat
can access note with a guid through explan
i prefer less interact as you can stop and process the inform more deepli
it’ easier to engag for a longer time rather than constantli paus the record and get distract i like discuss thing too but we don’t have an option to do that realli
becaus wirh record lesson i van watch them whenev and how mani time i want
i can go back and revisit record lectur
i prefer to just be email the work and get on with it by myself than do an onlin class
you can ask specif question when you need to
easier to ask question and get help
both upload materi and record video
even though i haven’t actual gotten thi i feel like i would much rather like thi instead becaus then it would feel like im actual be taught just as if i were at school with the teacher it would feel like i wa actual in class and it would be so much easier to learn than have to basic teach yourself everyth
zoom can be awkwardnot effect if not use correctli
it’ interact and can have discuss
we can work at our own pace there is no rush to complet thing in a particular time frame
i can go back to it if i’m not understand someth
can access it when need can look back on it and get more detail than just a powerpoint slide
it the most engag to me hear and see the teacher help me focu it easier to particip the teacher answer immedi and the other student benefit from that aswel it the most social method sinc everyon is connect live so it allivi loneli and it the most motiv to keep a steadi daili routin
greater interact with the lectur and mirror face to face learn the best
more engag
you can get an instant respons with question delv deeper into discuss and make sure you’r in the same place as everyon els
way more live easier to understand the materi easier to ask question
it allow immedi feedback from student
i find it hard to focu when im not do my own research
they r inform and fun
you get the inform still in classform but you can watch it later when you have time on your pace
i can rewind the video to go over somth
better engag less bore more benefici work
it offer more activ learn which is better for me
promot activ engag
keep me motiv see my teacher and classmat
most use to be abl to discuss materi and ask question
more interact with teacher veri similar to class
easi to follow and do in your own time
you can alway come back to what you didn’t understand
onlin dissect do not work but lectur are pretti easi to do onlin
we get to interact with everyon
most similar to standard lectur
less interact
i can get it done in my own time usual faster
can be more interact
thi mean i can go through the materi in my own pace
it physic make you do the work and help you keep a routin to maintain product the teacher ask question so you have to pay attent prevent you drift off and in gener it’ nice to see and hear someon a outsid your household i think it make you feel more connect and not so isol
zoom
easier to interact with teacher and support the success flow of teach and learn through question and discuss
make you more account and provid a basic structureschedul
i am abl to paus the video and go back if i miss someth or if i need to listen to it again
becaus there is a lot of disturb caus by few student and also network connect
most interact most like normal class
becaus you are abl to ask ani question dure the class they split us into studi room so we can talk with our cours mate about the topic we are learn about which help with understand it
more interact
sometim the internet disturb onlin class loss of connect bad video etc
becaus most of the time it is engag and it nice to have human interact
i can skip over part i find unnecessari
it’ possibil to stop record lectur whenev you want and you can creat your own schedul
becaus i can ask the teacher question
more interact more realist to actual school environ
i think live class will be difficult to manag and i would login just to show that i log in whilst if lesson are pre record for us and avail to access at ani time i think i would benefit from that more it would be easier to take detail note and i can adapt the work into the time that i’d be most product at
zoom is good
abl to do work when i want
have live class forc you to be ahead of your work or at least not to fall behind
becaus you are abl to see everyon els includ the teacher and it forc me to concentr and organ my day
closest to normal class and work well abl to interact with classmat
there is more of a chanc to engag with the materi and discuss it to make sure i have understood
freedom to express and listen to opinion
becaus i can ask immedi if i have ani issu about the lectur
i feel you are forc to focu for these which reduc my procrastin and also help with ani question i may have
you get to particip and it’ more difficult ti lose focu but veri necesarili it is to be combin with power point and lectur
for lectur i prefer record and for seminar zoom meet record are more time effici for lectur and paus them can help you take good note
teacher contact teacher can explain opportun to ask question
feel the most like human contact
you can listen to the content without have to be visibl such as a zoom call and you can revisit the content
i can interact with the teacher and ask question
becaus i can complet the task in my own time i also find that dure actual onlin class eg zoom meet i lose my abil to concentr after five minut or so
can watch whenev
more interact than record lectur
i can do it at my own pace but it is record like a normal lesson in school we haven’t actual had mani lesson like thi mostli just materi sent to us
i feel like it‘ more engaginginterest than simpli get thousand and thousand of paper to read or so it feel like
it’ similar to an alevel lesson environ as teacher talk over powerpoint give a greater depth of explan it can be done at ani time therefor give student flexibl
can watch at ani time more flexibl
i feel it the closest experi to be at school
it is most similar to in person uni teach
same send as a live class as the teacher is explain it but i can paus and look thing up in note if i don’t understand sometim live class go too fast
i’m abl to learn the content as well as discuss and engag with other peopl dure thi quiet time in lockdown
easier to just get on with it
if feel have discuss with other student and tutor i am abl to interact with the content in a much more extens sometim even more person way i find myself be actual abl to form an opinion by see how ither have interprest text and idea some disagre with the lectur or author
face to face contact make it easier to ask question and go more in depth about what you’r learn also as i take french and spanish i need practic speak the languag
i can do it at ani time
go through at your own pace
more close to real cours
easier to engag
i like hear the materi be taught but also go at my own pace so i can paus at anytim and just take note if need
i can organ my studi way better when i’m not follow strict schedul dictat by lectur
thi is the onli option we have
prefer have a two way dialogu
in some situat it realli feel as though you are in a proper classroom with your teacher and you can forget that you are not
becaus it forc me to remain focus as i could be ask question and i get to see hear other student particip
have the option to speak to my teacher whilst stay at home ha help me manag to stay on top of my school work
you can learn in your own time
it can contain interact
good for differ time zone and can watch multipl time
my cours is a role on role off at ani time style cours thi mean we are all at veri differ stage of complet so by just email upload what we have todo it mean save time listen to a zoom call when everyon is given differ thing to do
you can go back and watch them multipl time and access them at time which are suitabl to your disrupt quarantin schedul
it‘ like an audiobook you can stop and start whenev you want
i don’t like live session becaus not a lot of work get done and there is alway silenc when teacher ask a question peopl interrupt each other by accid
it is veri similar to normal school and we all need some normal
becaus you can interact with your teacher and student
can access whenev you want
i find it easier to understand the content when it is spoken by someon els and i can watch it at ani point in the day allow me to be more flexibl
through record lectur you get to understand the subject in your own time and paus to do some reasearch on someth which isnt possibl dure zoom lesson also my uni ban the record of class so that not good
so i can watch at a convieni time and can paus to take note
it forc you to actual attend
you can hear the inform be deliv as well as read it
live class is the close to actual interact which is someth we all are lack
becaus i will have to attend without be lazi
a lot of stuff can be left out on email and there are delay when you ask a question and need an answer a video call is great becaus it live and you can ask and answer question there and then it also make you feel less alon be on call with your class and lectur
it provid a more human feel
caus you dont have to stick to a specif time to watch it and you can also watch the lectur as mani time as you want if you did not understand someth you can go back and forward stop it
i can work through the materi at my own pace
interact
can access at a time which suit you can pauserewind easili when make note
you can do the class in your own time
i can stop them whenev i like and take note down but also note the time if i have ani question
becaus you have an interact with your classmat and your teacher
easier to paus and follow can alway go back to materi
more visual and can listen to someon els explain it
not onli are you abl to get some sort of facetofac teach but you also have a chanc to see how peopl are cope
i go to art school so my work is about 90 practic we stop all practic element of our cours as it’ just not possibl to teach thi onlin as we don’t have access to materi and studiosworkshop our onli non practic modul is design histori which we were email i realli like thi as i have poor internet access so it meant i can access it whenev and take as long as i need view it we had some zoom lectur but my connect wa too poor so it kept freez among other issu which made it harder
it make me feel like im part of a commun connect with peopl it allow us to ask question in real time teacher respond to you and that make me feel seen
you can have more interact like you would in class
motiv easier to understand and learn
it doe depend on the alevel subject but it would be more benefici when learn new year 13 content especi for math thi is becaus you would be abl to ask question straight away and gain a quick respons current onli busi ha done two live lesson on googl meet for 25 minut but within in thi time the teacher explain how to answer the question on the work set which wa realli use
easier to understand when someon is actual tell you the inform rather than copi down from a ppt
as i’m work with other i’m more inclin to work as i’m not alon
the materi is better when live
freedom to watch whenev and go back
you can work at your own pace
it is much harder to take note and stay concentr in a live class
i can work at my own pace and i don’t have to deal with the faf about in a lesson
becaus i can learn at my own pace
most clear and structur
forc you to engag and do it
mean i can focu on listen and take in the inform as oppos to simpli read a lesson plan on an email screen
live class and upload materi
so that i can keep to my regular schedul instead of have to motiv myself to watch the pre record lectur whenev
i’m a auditori learner also if my teacher is present the lesson onlin i can ask question and know that i am do the correct work
interact
some peopl in class just do not know how to mute themselv through record video it’ just the teacher and you
more interact more attent
easier to interact with the teacher right there and then and also learn from other ask question even though you think you understand that topic for exampl you may not
it allow for the same interact that is in the classroom which is incred import for subject that involv discuss or practic activ also dure thi lockdown it’ nice to hear my classmat voic
it seem the most ‘normal’ as you can see the lectur and other cours mate
i can listen to them whenev i want and becaus live session requir huge internet data
becaus the teacher are talk to us and we can ask question instead of talk to cameraman in madeira just in thi island for high school portug we also have class in the tv
becaus it mean i can complet work in my own time howev it doe mean i have to have more motiv to stick to a product set routin which can be difficult
i realli prefer to have the studi materi in an email form becaus i find it a better way to revis and understand new thing through task and all and the constant process of do the exercis again and again also when were given the materi explain and written down it help me more i dont realli know whi and though it sometim hard to have question i prefer it to onlin cours where all student are togeth talk all at the same time depend and even the internet connect is constantli cut it tire and i thing have the studi materi sent is way better to me person i hope thi make sens

becaus i can interact with my professor and it also give a “schedule” or a specif time to do uni work an focu on that

caus i work better by my own i dont focu in onlin class as much as regular class so id rather work by my own with the given materi than attend onlin class
i brainstorm the best when put in contact with other student in onlin class thi mean see other teacher and student on video and be abl to chat directli

it can be done at a time more suitabl for me and i can adapt my learn to my need much better
you can choos when to watch them and paus to take note
more interact
i am in year 13 so my exam were cancel so were not essenti to complet the work onli if we want to complet the cours for ourselv or wa hope to resit in the autumn
would forc me to attend as you have an assign time a routin wherea record lectur it veri easi to skip one you don’t want to do interest you less sinc there is noth forc you to do them
we can have actual discuss

it allow the class to have more frequent and help discuss with the teacher more easili and thi help to better emul a real classroom lesson
you can do it whenev you want dont have to hand it in on time
it’ good to take note as u can rewind my school hasn’t offer ani zoom or discuss forum which would be great so out of what we have had thi would be it

i am abl to go at my own pace and ultim produc better qualiti work and have a better understand
you are have the inform said to you and you still can see your classmat
i find it easier as i can work at my own pace and would find live lesson a far to pressuredstress environ to work in especi due to a low level process disabl i have thi is back up by live forum and weekli or fortnightli tutori for addit help and question which also work well for my a level
you can ask question if you are unsur of the content
becaus it’ like have a real class l but from home and you can paus it
direct and immedi contact with the teacher
i can work with my peer more
can go at my own pace
you can whenev you have time
it’ easier to particip
feel more like lesson we had in person
i can paus it look at the transcript hear it and see it it gener explain better and i can research thing on my own after that if i need further clarif and it a lot less anxieti than live class
becaus live meet reli on have a stabl connect which shouldnt be taken for grant and are also extrem ineffici compar to prerecord lesson i havent properli tri ani other method though
take away the anxieti of facetofac teach is revisit isn’t time restrict give us more time to think about what we’r go to saywrit than in seminar
it’ most like normal lesson i can replay video
feel similar to a lectur and can go back to the video at a later point if you miss someth that wa said
i prefer listen rather than activ take part thi may be becaus english is my second languag
can studi at your own pace and in your own time
becaus then i get to particip dure the lesson which is a veri import part of the lesson for me
i can choos when to watch it and how i can stop the video to take note and go backward to rewatch someth
more interact and feel a bit more like normal
there’l be much need interact between student and teacher as well as your question will be answer befor proceed to ani other concept instead of wait to type out the question later to your teacher
becaus it similar to physic class
a lot more motiv than just be set work blindli increas engag and my motiv for class
can look back over what everyon ha said and can look back for inform about someth im struggl with
more enjoy and the inform is more like to stick
much better explan
it a clear explan live class often have a bad connect
it allow for process the read materi through discuss as i prefer to do and i am less like to start run behind as is the case with the prerecord lectur right now
feel more realist and there’ not the pressur that come from a live call for the student to answer
it help you learn rather than just constantli do work
more interact and most similar to usual lectur
easiest way to discuss and get idea across clearli
live class are veri badli organ most professor dont have an internet connect strong enough so the audio is often affect i also find it veri hard to focu when it come to onlin class regardless of how much i tri it just not the same as class back at colleg i found that even if we do live class professor somehow got wors at explain concept so it kinda useless they werent at all prepar and it show
more guidanc and discuss involv
i like the fact i can paus the lectur if i’v miss someth or chang the speed for lectur who have speak too fast or slow
if it’ record i can listen to it when it best suit me at a time i can put all my focu and attent follow on with thi method i have time to think of ani question i may have and email them after to class and not feel pressur to talk dure live class ie zoom
i’m abl to ask my lectur question if i’m confus and it also motiv me to continu work
i’m not veri social so i realli enjoy be abl to just work at my own pace and ask question if i had them it also meant that i could do the work whenev i’m a total night owl and did most of the work outsid of school hour
it help to mantain some sort of interact between the student and the instructor
i can do it at ani time and at my own pace
give you the abil to have greater teacher contact
more interact with teacher abl to ask question if you don’t understand
it is the most similar to a normal passion although i onli had one or two as my school hasn’t done much onlin learn
becaus it allow me to learn at my own pace and i find onlin lectur veri hard to follow
feel like how it wa befor we had to move onlin
it is more interact and i feel i learn more when the teacher is teach live as it is also want i am normal use to
easier to commun
be abl to watch at later daterepeatpaus especi while have other stuff to do work volunt at hospit doctor thesi in germani alongsid univers
more interact and mean that you stay on time and schedul i found record lectur upload powerpoint with voic note allow me to slack off which i hate and i never stuck to my colleg schedul
class particip
it is a visual form of learn but unlik a live class you can rewatch the lectur and go over section you may have miss
becaus you can’t go wrong and it’ the most similar to befor
can do it in my own time unlik zoom call
not comfort with live video chat
possibl to make question the professor is abl to adjust the lectur to the student who are listen record lectur have the paus botton howev they tend to be more condens a littl to much and it harder to keep up with them
easi to ask question teacher can easili help student
i can get help from other or the teacher if need
it the closest thing i can get to actual contact time with teacher and it easier to fulli concentr and learn with a teacher present on a live class
feel more like school as normal as we can all discuss togeth and take valuabl point from other even when not see them
i can re check the lectur whenev i want and multipl time if need
to much of zoom lesson are waist on peopl not particip end with the teacher call random peopl out which is also uncomfert most knowledg is gain through the lectur but it doe work well to have follow up zoom meet where you can ask question
becaus you can do it when you want
becaus it’ far more interact and as close to face to face learn as possibl
it feel more like a real lesson
you can choos the time and stop if you are tire
we use to do live 1 on 1 tutori made it easier to discuss our work but now for safeti reason it all ha to be type for eved
you have a teacher in front of you through technolog so you can ask question if you’r confus wherea if you are just do assign sent to you and if you get confus you either have to write it on your work or email your teacher and wait for a respons which then may not help you as it can be difficult to teach through text
live class with upload materi give help us to stay in contact with teacher while be abl to also ask question about task that have been given
becaus i get the same experi as i would in my uni class in person
more interact
allow for activ discuss and explan as oppos to unclear instruct
becaus some of the content is realli challeng so i can paus it and take my time watch and learn rather than have to rewatch
as i can easili ask my teacher ani question i have regard the inform which is not easi to do when it’ just upload to googl classroom and you don’t get ani help
becaus it allow me to rewind and take note at my own pace
you can ask question
it more interact and you tend to be less distract when you have to activ listen and take note than when you can paus a record lectur
question can be answer in real time
interact possibl and just a more engag and motiv method
question can get answer quicker than through email
becaus you can discuss thing with your peer in real time and it feel the most like ‘normal school’
it give me more structur
video meet are bore and i prefer upload materi becaus i can just do it whenev i want
becaus we get to interact in real time with instructor
becaus it the most similar to how it wa when we were at school it give a sens if normal also the live factor mean you cant miss it and you are be almost held account for your presenc
you can watch them as mani time as you need and you can paus them to take note and you creat your own schedul you don’t have to watch them at a certain time
becaus like that it’ easiest to manag your time
flexibl of schedul the abil to paus and reflect when i need to and take the time to fulli absorb the inform i am an independ learner and i benefit from read and listen to inform if i have ani further question i can follow up on the discuss board or via email
can catch up on it whenev is suitabl
becaus i can watch whenev i want the record class and in case i have ani doubt i can email the teacher to ask them and we can even discuss it by zoom or ani live platform
it involv discuss with peer on the content assign thi allow activ learn as compar to record lectur or zoom class
it is easier to manag my own time thi way and im more focus when i have to understand by myself
it’ a way to keep you motiv to attend to class and you can ask question
can watch everyth in your own time
it still hold you account you are forc to pay attent
thi is all we have been given
give the necessari knowledg and allow for student to learn the materi when best for them mental
can interact with the tutor and ask question when you need
becaus there is some kind of interact that is need
can do in my own time zoom are unproduct
it’ interact and the best substitut for a real lesson
you can complet your work at ani time in the day compar to have to be onlin at a certain time
i can listen to it whenev i want to and as much as i want to
i learn best by discuss stuff as it help me understand thing better
it allow to interact and ask question like in a normal lesson
becaus we get to interact with the teacher and the materi studi more
more interact and get to ask question on the stop
becaus it make it easier to understand the topic
i prefer the live class as i think thi give me more of a structur lesson routin whilst at home i also think the live class make it easier to be abl to ask questionsy can gain support easier if need
live class often don’t give me enough time to process the new inform so have record lecturesvideo allow me to go at my own pace
allow student to fulli engag and ask question at ani point aswel as provid a challeng as addit work can be set
more engag than the record lectur seminar are conduct live and provid direct contact with the instructor while record lectur can be veri difficult to motiv oneself for
you could do record class anytim you can also you have a chanc to be back and revis class when it need sometim internet connect is too slow that whi live class becom annoy and useless
i can access it at ani time howev sometim it would be better to have zoom seminar as well as record lectur
more customiz and tailor to our own pace of learn
you can ask the teacher question
teacher often explain thing in greater depth can explain through their prefer teach style which the student will be use to
can view it at ani time
i am not a fan of onlin learn to be honest and would prefar learn in class but i am fine with zoom googl meet etc
as i can paus and rewind and spend as much time as i need on the lectur and then email about ani question i have or anyth after
the live interact with other peopl help materi to be learnt and consolid
becaus you cant postpon the cours so your more on track
interact learn is a lot more effect
it is the most similar to our normal educ which work quit well mostli it also mean that our work is monitor so we are oblig to do the work
more interact so can ask question
i can see other student respons that are more curat than just on a zoom meet or someth
thi allow up to activ learn ask question on the spot and allow me to understand easier
can be done in own time prefer to work in even and spend day with familyoutsid
you feel like you’r in an actual lesson the email materi we fill out on a doc doesn’t realli go in or feel like learn
i can go at my own pace and it kinda sad when no one realli particip n the teacher just start name calling💩
you could still interact with teacher and other student dure lesson
i can ask the teacher question whenev i have a doubt in a more immedi way also i prefer to listen to my own teacher explain instead of see video on youtub becaus i know what inform they find most import
abl to interact with other peopl and the peopl you would normal spend time with abl to engag in discuss similar to in person lesson
i often lose concentr and interest dure lectur to me they are a wast of time i prefar to work on my own that way i can work quicker and understand the materi better
you can paus it and do it in your own time so at time when you feel you will be more immers in the subject
you have an ad level of account that ensur you actual do watch the lectur and it bring structur to your day
current can look back on it easi to revis from almost easier and more help than be at univers

the lesson retain longer on my head if i can visual see it and hear someon talk about it henc video is easier for me
more interact like wed have for actual school in person get the chanc to ask question in real time
can make interact video with checkpoint quizz etc which we can rewind if we don’t understand learn at own pace
commun is easier
hear someone’a verbal explain someth is much more easi to grasp
it gener the largest amount of interact possibl between student and faculti
i can go through at my own pace and can email chat over zoom if i have further question
i can ask question when they aris
straight to the point content even though i like discuss on video call microsoft team
we have more contact with our professor

i like get the possibl to particip in an exchang of idea and to experi person intercours
becaus i can stop the video and take better note
actual discuss in zoom call it’ mostli the prof speak and if we would like to discuss stuff it get realli messi just not like real life so that’ whi i like the chat you can craft your answer answer and quot specif stuff and don’t fear talk over somebodi accident
i like feel like im not in it alon

i can do the task whenev i want to
it prevent procrastin and the lectur are there to answer ani question if i have them wherea it it a record lectur i’ll have to email my tutor and it will take day to get a respons
i prefer to learn via video as i like to make my own note from what i gain out of the class
time differ wont be a factor affect my pursuit of educ

a lot more comfort with discuss via type as i’m less like to interrupt somebodi els

becaus we would have done what we normal do in a lesson
less stress and easier to focu but also the option to ask question and get help
becaus you can ask question in real time and speak to your peer
my degre requir the level of interact that can onli be mimick through zoom
it’ the format closest to my usual method of teach in person seminar
i can easili ask question without have to wait for somebodi to repli
i think it’ most similar to a classroom set
right mix between have input from teacher and also be abl to do independ studi
easier to interact with teacher and other classmat
engag with peopl
live class
it give the enthusiasm to do the work as i need to be present in front of my teacher rather than leav it up to my own devic i’m a procrastin haha
becaus it enabl me to studi in my own pace which make it easier for me to realli engag with the materi
the direct contact give at least some form of engag where you can ask question directli
i can organ my day and watch the lectur when i feel most product
it allow for interact as discuss of idea between teacher and we can split off into group for project too it’ nice that with my school we don’t have our camera off and microphon off in lesson so that it’ less invas and for mani less intimid we do turn out mic on for answer question when instruct
work get explain and you can keep go over a point you don’t understand
more engag
i’m an essenti worker so be abl to fit studi around work and work around studi is import
becaus there a differ between read a text alon and understand the text by yourself then ask question on a forum that dont work well and where your question dont get an extend and explain answer than have to read the text and then proceed to have your teacher answer question at the same time you are ask them i dont even know my professor face there like 6 professor and i bare know their name is kinda dehuman becaus im not even talk with a person im just read a premad power point without ani other explan
student engag is better
becaus we can interact with the teacher and class
it is better to understand the materi that we have to learn
easier to ask question
i like be abl to ask teacher question and see the answer to question that other student have ask sinc our lectur are record i like be abl to look back at them at a later time
becaus you can actual interact with the teacher and ask question when you wantne to
it forc you to pay attent
i learn faster on my own class via zoom take too much of my time
you can go back over them if requir also paus and start again realli benefici
i prefer live class becaus they are the most interact you can ask question directli and it’ most like the physic class howev my school doesn’t provid that mani onlin class and most of the educ i get is by have deadlin everi two day for certain class
you can paus the video if you dont understand someth
easiest and most effici to use comprehend
more suit to individu schedul can go at my own pace and less anxietyinduc than zoom call
you have to attend so mean you have to have structur routin
work to print off or work off of the laptop
it work the fastest
face to face can be so valuabl when the teacher is explain someth
becaus the live class are veri counter product
becaus you can see what the lectur is present and how they elabor on differ point
it encourag independ studi
still get human interact abl to ask question at the time and have them answer
you’r abl to appli your learn and most importantli interact with other peopl ask question share idea debat etc it make me more account for my learn
help with combat procrastin can ask question directli
it more activ
can easili interact with teacher and access knowledg quicker
it is easier to learn thi way
becaus it give you feel like your attend normal class and you can ask question and have live discuss
it let me work at my own pace
video allow the lectur to speak and describ more in detail than if the powerpoint wa just upload alon
i can work through it in my own time no need to join a chat or call at a specif time
it is much easier to ask question and clarifi and i also feel that i pay more attent and am more focus which mean ill understand the content better
becaus it give me the freedom to readdo it whenev i feel like i’m abl to do ut best
i like be abl to see people’ face and be abl to ask question as we go etc
abl to ask question more easili than if i were to send my teacher an email
more interact and easier to commun
becaus i don’t wast ani of my time than while teacher are do their lectur time expand it’ bore while if teacher assign you a video to see the knowledg you need will be compress and you don’t loos ani time on the other hand if you are take note you can take them quietli without loos anyth becaus you can adjust the video
becaus it’ the closest to ideal and in person class
you can do it at ani time you want but it also depend on the subject for some topic live class with immedi answer are better in order to understand everyth
commun
becaus our lesson actual get explain to us
can dip in and out not at a set time
we can ask our question immediatli and becaus it is hard to find a good organ by myself it oblig me to actual follow the lectur and to not postpos the view of the record video
becaus i can interact with my teacher and my classmat
i am quit shi and social awkward so i would rather just have the work email to me without have to go on a live class
teacher wast our time in live class explain thing we could just as well watch as a video i wish they would use the live class for question instead of explan
it’ the onli way for me to activ engag
becaus that the one i feel most engag in and i find it easiest to stay focus in comparison with the other mode
you can work in your own time
ive never had the experi of ani of the other so i cant comment on if i like them although live lesson via a video chat would make me veri anxiou
feel more like lectur
i’m abl to work at my own pace
becaus i can work toward it in my own time and my own pace by make thorough note on the info
becaus i am not comfort about talk in front of 60 peopl but i would be with email or sth
with upload materi we are abl to have a depeer understand of it and if we have ani dificulti we can check the lectur or ask the lectur it also requir an activ mode of learn
it is the onli thing my colleg have done so i have noth to compar it to
do it at my own pace
you can work on your own schedul
it feel like we are actual in a normal class in school also if anyon ha ani doubt the teacher can repli immedi it’ great to see your classmat and interact with them as well
can ask live question
i much prefer verbal explan than just learn from written content although there is written content alongsid which is still realli help i have been receiv small group video call cambridg supervis onlin but i struggl with these due to anxieti especi sinc everyon can see my face at all time and symptom of increas anxieti show on my face
i can work on my own pace
then im in the abil to immedi ask question but also to have more of a social experi in which everyon can have a laugh about someth or we can elabor on each other question
it would be good as we would actual get taught someth and could have discuss
you are given the abil to work at your own pace
it keep the interact go
i feel like i would actual be learningb taught properli
more interactiveperson more like the real thing
instructor give more explan than on their slide and i can watch the video at a conveni time
bc you actual engag in the class and therefor put work into the subject you also get some motiv to do pre or after work
nice to hear a voic stop me from procrastin
ha a set time so i can plan my day
interact learn is more effect
allow some direct content and answer question in chat help with consolid
you can paus and rewind easili and there is no pressur to answer question compar to in a live class
it is easi to just not watch reacord lectur with live class it feel the most ‘normal’
can commun with the teacher and ask question
it’ in live time so you can ask for help and it’ so much more friendli you don’t feel so alon in lockdown just gener at home
conduct in the time i would actual be at uni normal
can follow at own pace
interact with the professor
i can ask question and not need to wait day for a repli and i learn better when we talk through concept
more engag
you can watch at ani time and come back to it when you’r do essay

it give me the freedom to plan my day without have to worri about differ onlin lectur if i didnt catch someth i can relisten to it
becaus it interest and interact
i can review note and inform at my own pace
for our school it’ either prerecord lectur or live tutori so i prefer tutori just for the sake of have as much human interact as possibl
i can understand concept better when they are explain to me instead of just a powerpoint
there is input from the teacher but i can go at my own pace
becaus it feel less lone give a sort of structur to the day and ani problem can be address right away rather than have to wait for clarif in an email
it’ more visual and ha more in depth explan
it allow us to engag with our class
it keep me on schedul time wise
allow us to ask question live
i have quit intens anxieti which wa made wors by the lockdown the pressur of have to log on and speak onlin to other student most of which i hadn’t met becaus it wa a new modul wa nervewrack i bare like phone call to peopl i alreadi know so have to do onlin seminar with a new teacher and new class realli affect my mental health like when the teacher ask if we had question i felt to nervou and anxiou to turn my mic on so end up deal with ani issu over email anyway a lot of what we dealt with in class easili could’v been done through materi email to us and teacher feedback rather than awkwardli wait for someon to speak in the onlin classroom mostli i’d prefer the email and forum due to my anxieti but also becaus i can easili reaccess that content if i need it
give me more of an incent to pay attent dure the lectur
it mirror an actual lesson the most
i can complet the work at my own pace
more realtim can ask question and then have them answer
i don’t feel nervou when sit in a lesson with teacher on a form of facetim i can also do thi in my own time
at home it’ harder to keep to specif time especi with the stress of covid19 would have been good to have the lectur record
more interact

it’ easier to get on with the work then ask when struggl yet we also need the live class for new content
it provid motiv to get up and log on becaus i have to see peopl face to face
it is possibl to paus andor go back if need
easier to follow along at ani point in the daynight
becaus it is easier to be motiv
anxieti over live class
it is more valuabl and i get more out of it some thing they upload don’t make sens and is hard to do it independ when your teach yourself everi thing
i am abl to go through it at my own pace
i get a better understand when the work is explain and gone through by my teacher rather then leav it open to my own interpret
can paus and take note as need and don’t have to worri about internet issu nois from other student etc
allow you to physic speak to your teacher
it would hold me account to actual particip and do my work when work is mere upload with a suggest that we do it it is veri hard to find the motiv to complet it
becaus you can interact with the teacher and get direct feedback
i can watch at my own pace
allow interact and clarif of topic
interact with classmat and teacher
visual interpret and understand the work better
live class encourag me to focu and have a schedul maintain a bit more normal
i find the involv of live video record of myself veri stress and it make it hard for me to concentr thi is whi i prefer chat where there is no video involv
it’ easier to contain inform thi way and also i can immedi ask question if i have ani
i think a mix of all is the best i had one onlin discuss so far and other than that i onli got email materi could’v use some more onlin class and discuss in forum
becaus than they teach us so we dont need to teach ourselv
i can just download the script and take them anywher to studi and i can go back and forth easili while take note
becaus it’ the closest to be on a real class
i can do it ani time make my own schedul
thi is my prefer mode becaus it’ easier to refer back if you’v miss someth and you can paus the video at ani given moment
becaus it easier for me to learn on my own that is in thi way those subject that are less interest to me are easier to do while the professor are alway there so that if i am interest in someth extra for answer to question addit literatur and even invit it is veri import to emphas that in our countri in serbia we go to that gener educ program where we studi all subject as in primari school onli all of them for a degre more i mean we dont have to choos the subject we want to focu on more we can choos the natur or social direct but again we have the same subject from
you can answer question and it alway take less than an hour
i can learn it at my own pace
becaus question can be answer in real time and it is less like for me to procrastin
alway the opportun to go back over when it come to revis and especi given the fact i had 24 hour “take home” exam wherea you don’t have that with live class zoom just more help in my opinion
easier to ask question and learn is more tailor to specif need
can studi on my own term
i get to commun with my friend and teacher at school
i like the freedom of be abl to do the lesson at my own pace
it provid at least some way of interact teach and learn
you can paus and look back
becaus it much more help especi for spanish it also help my mentak health be abl to hear familiar voic

record lectur enabl you to take your time with the learn process you can rewind and slow the video down accord to your own conveni addit they take off the ad stress of have to show up to live lectur with the teacher expect that youv caught up with the previou day content
it’ my prefer method becaus i can studi at my own pace
it’ more flexibl i can complet my work when i want to and it allow me to take more indepth note and work at my own pace i also find it more help as i am a visual learner
i can select when i take the class to suit my brain i’m not a morn person but am alloc to morn class
be abl to have a question answer in detail in convers would allow me to understand the solut a lot more
becaus it’ more engag and set a routin in the dag

idk mayb becaus it live
more interact feel more like normal uni

abl to decid when i watch lectur
becaus you can ask question more often in the lesson rather than constantli email your teacher and feel like your annoy them
it allow for easi studi at ani time
even though were not actual there it the closest thing to physic be in a lectur it also forc me to focu unless ill miss someth
thi way student can ask the question that come to their mind right on the spot as they would in a regular classroom set it’ also import for peopl to have « normal » human interact and stick to regular routin as much as possibl so have live class would be benefici to student mental health
i can learn and studi at my own pace
i find onlin seminar through forum to be slow and ineffect
you have to be engag and you can ask question there and then
more interact
i can complet the work in my own time
easier for me person to work from take note pay attent do at my own pace etc
becaus i can learn whenev i feel like it and i am more motiv that way becaus i drift off easili whenev we have a live class with record lectur i don’t have that problem i can also listen to it again when i forget someth

it mean that we can work it out by ourselv and easili ask the teacher ani question we have
record lectur
just as effect as in person learn
i can studi at my own time and conveni
for art and design most of our work need to be discuss befor we move further with our work
watxh them when you want
easier to ask question and better explan
easier
i can visualis the materi and it explain to me whilst i can see the question in front of me
the email are too much
i learn better when i have someon explain it to me rather than me have to figur it out by myself
forc myself get out of comfort zone and sit down to learn
i prefer record lectur bc your abl to adjust the speed i prefer live workgroup bc your abl to ask question and discuss the literatur

you can contribut more inform thi way oftentim as a quieter person i find it hard to speak up without be abl to make physic cue ie put hand up etc thi way i can contribut without feel like i’m say too much or interrupt other peopl
i can manag my own time and work when i feel the most product
well i wouldnt say that i have some prefer mode becaus i havent realli tri mani we just mostli use upload materi and sometim record lectur
thi way studi feel more like what im use to in school
i am abl to work at my prefer pace but also have audio and physic explan rather than just read

actual interact with tutor is way better for learn
i get more interact with my teacher
i like studi and work on thing on my own and at my own speed and becaus i am right befor my final exam we did not have to go through ani new materi the live class onli took away my studyrevis time and i felt like i didnt learn that much
can watch back whenev is conveni and at my own pace
feel luke a classroom where work upload onlin is easi to fall behind on and procastin as there is no set time or commit
becaus it give you an opportun for discuss question and feel like you are more in a class which make you more motiv to learn
i’m a visual learner and i like have thing explain by the teacher
becaus we can exchang idea
you can ask question ask for clarif etc and it’ more engag than the other form you also have to tune in to it so it’ easier to motiv yourself
it is far easier to get clear and instantan feedback plu you can easili ask question
it hold me account for attend class instead of decid to have class whenev
you are abl to organ your own day make your own schedul and do the assign whenev you want to
allow you to work in your own time
we all teacher and student use it and there a common
as it is more interact therefor if i am confus i am abl to get one on one help
you can access it at ani time you want and can paus or rewind unlik an onlin class
it’ engag compar to watch video or be in a larg meet with a teacher
zoomliv meet are veri tire and you have to fulli concentr for the whole durat whilst record lectur you can paus and go at your own speed
becaus you can ask your question and get answer right away it is also more interest that discuss room
i take mainli discuss base class so it is easier to replic in person through live class except i also think live class caus problem if you don’t have reliabl internetcomput or not safe place to do class expos issu of inequ
listen to my teacher talk about it give me a better understand on the topic
allow me to work on my own time frame no need to rush of worri about miss class
easiest to understand and ask question
it mean i can go at my own speed and take proper neat note and highlight
it ha more structur than live lesson while replic a real classroom set more effect than email materi or discuss forum
i can work through the set materi at my own pace
becaus the one class that had thi method wa much more effect it made it less tediou and gave me my own time to work
in most of subject i can learn better when the cours is written
easi to organis what work you need to do and by when abl to work at your own pace
it give a sens that im share the lectur time with real peopl lectur and classmat not just a video
allow engag
i enjoy the interact with teacher and other student
more regular in my schedul
abil to spend howev long i want on differ exercis and do further research without time pressur
you have the opportun to engag with the content a lot better for exampl ask question explain it to other or let it be explain furthermor it give you a certain routin after a „call“ is set at a specif time
i can do it at my own pace
becaus when someth is unclear i can still ask for clarif
better explan yet no internet interrupt
abl to paus take my time to think about concept
i can watch them at my own pace and when i choos to
interact with my classmat and teacher
more teacher interact and abil to ask question
i prefer figur out the task by myself thi help me to read more about the subject in my own when i don’t understand make me fulli engag in what i do
it’ the closest to a classroom set
becaus i can chose my own time to watch the lectur
provid explain and teach need to complet work
due to connect issu live class are not ideal and as such discuss forum too record materi doesnt requir a lot of interact
human interact
have the abil to review lectur
more interact quick answer to doubt
still allow teacher to explain content to you and allow for question to be answer on the spot closest to in class teach
it is much easier to quickli digest the inform be provid when it is spoken oppos to written
i find it much easier to learn when i can see a human explain it and work through exampl rather than tri to learn from a textbook
it’ nice to be abl to talk to teacher even if it is quit awkward sometim
becaus i can paus the video to take note and watch again the part more difficult to understand
no judgement when other can’t see you
give my day structur
i’m more engag as it feel like i’m still in school
you can watch the lesson at ani time suit to you
upload on canva or googl classroom
it allow me to complet and learn new materi in my own time
i can ask question and it feel a lot more like a class rather than just be sent work which i struggl to do
i enjoy have upload or email materi becaus then you can work at your own pace wherea in live meet you are beholden to the speed of the instructor wether that be too fast or too slow
feel real
abl to ask question and interact
no specif time limit
i can do it on my own time and take as long as i need on one assign
you can ask question
more interact allow for live discuss and it stop you feel lone or isol as you learn
it actual make me do someth for the cours becaus it make me account in front of the lecturerclass i thought upload materi or learn platform record lectur forum and upload materi will be my prefer mode but i find myself not actual do anyth for the cours i must say for me person the best option is a whole learn platform or upload materi togeth with a live class thi class doesnt necessarili need to take place everi week
class discuss can occur more effect as it the most close to how colleg is run
it more person and it easier to ask question
i like to be given assign for me to research and work independ etc
allow discuss and to ask question if you don’t understand what’ been said
much more interact and easier to express question and thought along with easier explan from teacher
live class provid more structur and allow realtim interact
feel like were actual be taught like in colleg and we can ask question on the spot
can paus and rewind anytim can watch it anytim
get one on one feedback with tutor and student
more chanc for discuss and quick respons to question
i like be abl to see and hear the teacher
i gain the most from thi as i’m abl to ask question and get quick respons
you are abl to get immedi feedback from teacher
it forc you to be more engag and to prepar develop point as you will be directli question and allow you to discuss idea with other peopl mimick a seminar face to face as much as possibl
more interact and forc you to pay more attent so retent of inform is higher
it‘ more interact
easier to break down as you can pauserewind etc if you lose focu at ani point
interact and more engag
you can repeat it as mani time as you want caus sometim it’ difficult to follow a class and at the same time take note
becaus se have interact between the teacher and classmat even though sometim is not so conveni as class are more so elabor as class at school we know we just have to adapt becaus there is no more option out there
closest to a real lecturetutori easiest to learn in
i have no motiv to sit for 1 and a half hour listen to a record lectur i zone out veri easili and don’t take in the content live lectur howev allow me to interact with my cours mate and lectur by askingansw question thi help me activ process the cours materi
it is the easiest
i can learn at my own pace
you actual engag with the lectur and understand is better
becaus it feel more activ than just sit there on zoom when i can zone out
i find work independ the best for me
you get to follow the class at your own pace and it’ veri use for student in a differ time zone like me
easi to understand interact
easier to process info and take note
more engag and it feel more like a classroom environ
i learn content better when i can visual see it explain like when it’ written
easier to engag and more motiv
easier commun twoway commun
mean you can choos when to do it
simpli be sent the task to do through our email doesnt give us a lot of support so prerecord lesson or even a zoom call would provid us with more help
live is more engag and forc me to go to class at the same time as i would if i wa on campu
becaus i have an unlimit access to the sent materi and can come back to them anytim even if my internet connect get lost i will be abl to obtain the inform later
abl to commun well with teacher to have a better qualiti of learn throughout lesson time
live class
it more human and it help me understand thing better i also feel like im actual take a class and not just watch youtub
feel more engag
i find live class more stress thi is less time consum with adequ commun to teacher in chat it is least stress
much more interact
it’ more similar to normal lesson
as i take a lot of time to understand some hard subject like biolog and chemistri therefor it is use that i can refer back to record lesson when i need to revis or go over someth i did not understand i also learn through hear and see therefor read materi are veri unhelp and see it explain is the best way i learn
quick to the point short and concis not veri confus to follow
they’r interact and easi to ask question or rais concern within i think they mimic the classroom atmospher the best too
i think it an easi way to learn
becaus you can ask your question directli to your teacher
it easier yo clear my doubt
i can work on my own
the lectur goe into detail as they would in normal inperson lectur email handout and discuss forum are often veri spars
i prefer take note as if i am in my class so i think thi stimul my previou work environ most close
becaus i get the benefit of an actual class but can fit it around my timet
it come closest to an actual class meet where you can activ engag in ask question about the content etc
i think that the class would be more engag and more like a classroom environ
if i were to use thi i believ it would provid more structur and keep me on track
interact
it the onli one ive tri
it is the onli one i’v had
when they email work i struggl to get the motiv and drive to put the effort into complet it on time and as i am out of routin and i will most like forget zoom make me think fast and inspir activ learn it make me realis how much littl time in the day i spend deep think in lockdown and it help to wake me up and use my energi correctli if it is a morn zoom meet it give me the motiv to actual wake up which is amaz becaus my sleep pattern is fall out of place
i feel uncomfort listen to my lectur voic whilst at home or freak me out written note are also easier to follow than recordingm when i have to rewind slow down etc
it allow the work to be complet asynchron which is great and make my life easier
becaus i am free in my time manag and can watch the lectur when i have time for it
i feel like it is more interact as professor are ask question and we can either answer on the chat or talk to the whole class
i’m an act major and the select class i took that onli use discuss board written assign didn’t teach me anyth about the craft i’m studi at school
you can ask question with instant answer
becaus the interact make you more engag in the cours and give you motiv to put the effort in
becaus if not then i won’t be engag enough
it forc me to be interact and give my day more structur than a lectur that i could procrastin watch
you can ask questuon immedi when need
so we can all interact with each other
it’ the closest to a real lesson
becaus that’ how i work best just given the inform and then interpret it my own way
actual interact with teacher and opportun to ask question
i find i can do the work more effici on my own to microsoft team meet
i chose upload materi for two reason one co it what my school is do so what im use to and it allow me to just get on and do it my own way howev i also do enjoy disscu ssion base learn
actual engag with teacher
becaus it give you a visual interpret
actual make me do it and watch it instead of if it’ just email i’m less motiv to start it
you get to ask question and speak face to face almost with your tutor
feel more like normal school
you can maintain a connect and relationship with teacher and classmat which be help to benefit my studi
it allow me to be flexibl about when i do it and it’ not too stress
i get to relax at home and it easi but teacher like to give their own input into the subject and they can manag time which i much prefer to copi out powerpoint etc
it’ much more interact be set independ task can be isol at time
it more engag and motiv if you have a set time plu it remind you that your not the onli one
access all the time
get to ask question
you can organ yourself and be more free also zoom meet can be realli exhaust whem you have to pay attent for 9h straight
it feel the most realist and structur and i find myself more readi to accept the materi
we can ask question within the lesson and it interact
i like hear the teacher explain thing becaus it is easier to understand thing compar to read a powerpoint also you can ask question and receiv immedi answer instead of wait for an email
becaus we are abl to watch and read ani inform or assign we are given whenev it is most conveni for us until the due date time
help stay organis as if the cours still took place at univers
zoomvirtu class meet and discuss caus me a lot of anxieti and it’ veri hard to focu dure them
allow for discuss and involv but at your own pace
so i have the platform to chat with my professor ask question and also learn from other question plu to feel that we are all in it togeth
i can decid myself when i watch the record thi way i can schedul my own time
you can ak question directli and dont need to wait bc you know that the teacher is avail dure thi live class
becaus i can work accord to my own flow and daili routin it also is just more individu i can take more time do for exampl math if i need to and no one tell me to hurri and go to anoth class
without distract or disturb from other student also take the class
it give me more time to do the work given and i get to choos the time that i actual work
record class come without 10 min of class be wast by have technic difficulti and disrupt you can do thing at your own time and speed throughout the day if you have ani question all you have to do is email or messag your teacher realli fast
it feel more normal have set time for lesson everyday wherea email are easi to ignor and procrastin
i think it is the best solut especi for peopl with weak wifi
there more of and interactionconnect between the student and the teacher it like be in an actual classroom environ
it’ much easier to focu
i can listen to them whenev i want
it’ more interact and allow for real time class discuss and instant feedback on idea an for aid when confus
it’ the most similar to be in an actual lesson as the teacher can talk to you in real time and you’r abl to ask about the cours content
i can decid when to take them and plan my own studi but the way our school is do them i cant
complet the lectur when they are set can ask question and interact put some structur into the day
the lectur themselv aren’t realli clear if our docotor isn’t explain them
i can do it in my own time without pressur from classmat
engag with other help me to understand the content better as i feel like a combin use of the visual through potenti diagram drawn and hand gestur made as well as peopl talk and give spontan exampl realli help me to understand also i’m less like to get distract becaus i can’t realli pay attent when i’m sat by myself
can be access in your own time
it more close resembl regular class
more in depth explan possibl than when just read from materi chanc of interact and question which is not possibl for record lectur
i get more in depth explanait than i do from email materi but i can do it at whatev time fit me best and it´ more relax than for exampl live class becaus i don´t have to immedi answer question and can watch it as mani time as i want to
it’ easier to ask ani question and get an immedi respons it is also good for class where we have in class discussionsdeb such as polit
it’ basic like normal lectur with the comfort of be at home or wherev els you are
becaus i can watch them whenev and wherev plu i can go back and watch certain part again if i miss them
googl meet class are either too short to actual learn the materi or they are extrem dull
that i can get back to it one i need it
easi to rewatch or paus if need
it would mean greater human interact between student and teacher in which the class can ask question and bounc off each other sometim there are question that you wouldn’t even think of but someon els would and vice versa and then it clear that up there and then i think it’ the best as it is the closest to actual be in the classroom and honestli i wish a level were taught thi way sometim especi when you miss school due to ill
it give you a chanc to come back to the materi and listen to it in your own time and space where you can concentr
keep me have a schedul and not have to reli on my self motiv to find time to take the class
allow me to work on my own time frame no need to rush of worri about miss class
it’ more interact
becaus you can paus it and take note onlin live zoom session are go a littl too fast in my opinion and therefor i have to rewatch it which cost a lot of time zoom session are conveni for question but i probabl won’t ask question becaus i’m still tri to figur out what ha been said rather than think about the subject
i can do the work at ani chosen time in the day that suit me best
i studi illustr as my core subject therefor explain and discuss my work verbal is veri import
you can interact with the tutor
we can fit it to our own schedul rather than live lesson which we have to work around
in person easier to pay attent more engag
i dont have to directli interact with other human be
i get to interact a lot more with the professor
it quit effect and feel like a classroom
you can access it ani time
i live in a differ time zone so thi is more conveni for me than live class although i prefer live in principl
you can do it at your own pace and when you want to do it
i can choos at what time i want to studi and i can go at my own pace
if it’ not live i feel like i don’t have to do it
i can get an instant respons to ani question ask and it seem to eas my workload
you can discuss with the teacher much more easili than over other platform
i get the feel of an actual classroom when the instructor is abl to explain inform live and therefor get to absorb the inform a littl better
especi in scienc subject i can paus or play the video again at ani time it help me get a better understand of the matter than if i were to make note from the textbook on my own
becaus it allow interact between the instructor and the student which i believ to be fundament
becaus you can go over the content as mani time as you would like
becaus you can actual ask question
live class will give you the chanc to interact with other student and teacher i person like better to have a conserv by talk than to write email
when i am uncertain about an assign i can ask my teacher right away when the document are upload to a platform i have to contact them with an email first thi will take longer than directli ask my teacher in the actual class
becaus it help to keep the same kind of dynam as actual class plu you can talk directli to the teacher
allow me to work on my own time frame no need to rush of worri about miss class
immedi feedback
more commun with other peopl
it’ more engag
it is veri quick to gain new inform and if you have ani doubt about anyth you can instantli ask your teacher it is also easi to discuss certain topic
it feel the most like a normal lesson
becaus if i have a question i can ask it while the class is still happen and that way im oblig to watch instead of procratin to watch record video os assign
can actual ask question without have to wait age for answer via email
it allow me to have more freedom in my day to plan it how i like and be more independ with my work thi mean i can choos the time of day that is best for me to work instead of work around multipl zoom lesson howev it is nice to have a small mix of thi too
instantli answer question
it forc me to get up and do work instead of stay in bed all day i can also ask question in real time
not reliant on specif time can work when i feel motiv
i thin the record lectur on the internet explain the subject much better than our live teacher and there are a lot of internet connect problem so it isnt veri effici
it’ most interact and help with hold yourself account
i’m quit shi
as it is how it would be in a classroom environ so easier to get into the work
becaus it in courag student to attend the class as well as it help you to interact with your peer
i can ask question and get back to the answer anytim
i feel connect to learn and actual work on uni work with close to none lectur or onlin resourc avail i dont feel like im learn anyth anymor
abl to paus
it’ like real teach but i can take it at my own pace
allow for more effect discuss
you get better answer from teacher as they don’t have to type it out you get to have class discuss
zoom cam with a learn curv for professor often time a lectur that wa suppos to be record for us to look back on wa not record becaus professor forgot or internet would cut out randomli or breakout session would be realli difficult to set up they eventu work themselv out but for the purpos of a lectur prerecord work so much better especi becaus peopl aren’t ask too mani question dure the live lectur
i can keepup with my work b3caus if it isnt live then i feel like itll make me lazier and feel too unreal
you can engag with the teacher and have interest discuss
becaus i can watch class when i prefer
becaus of the faster interact and possibl to ask question
when class are pre record i tend to procrastin more
allow me to work at my own pace and go back over the materi while still receiv actual teach from my teacher and hear their opinion we are gener given a class discuss space alongsid it which work well in tandem
becaus i can activ discuss and understand the content instead of just listen to it
i can manag my own time
it’ similar to a normal lesson
it is interact and closer to a convent classroom
it’ explain in more depth and you can go back to it to clarifi point
can set my own schedul
i can alway go back to the section where i could have misheard or to clearli understand the inform
it make you actual go to them and tri and engag better when they are record i had a tendenc to just read the materi and not listen
it’ more interact with the teacher
i feel like i get the most inform from the lectur whilst my seminar on blackboard collabor dont cover a lot and i might as well not go to them
due to my poor internet connect it wa the best option i had to keep up on my uni class
i’m an audio learner so record lesson allow me to not onli learn effici but i can paus and replay ani content in order to understand it better
there are no problema with the connect onc that you download the lesson
record video along upload materi
it the easiest
becaus then you can ask question to your teacher
interact with teacher
i think it easier to commun with fellow peer lectur and other univers lectur zoom can be too hectic sometim and it hard to get your point across so do it through a chat you can receiv a better respons
it easi to engag without feel too self consciou
you can watch it on your own time you can paus the lectur to take note
easi to paus and go back on more difficult materi
it maintain my engag
i studi math so i like to be abl to paus the video and think about the complic concept the teacher is talk about and i can email my teacher later about the question
i would like for the proffesor to record their lectur but also teach them live i often get distract or am too caught up tri to write note that i get lost sometim and it nice to have that freedom to be abl to rewatch them again
becaus we can engag in convers have a routin and ask question on the spot
feel like im in actual class
there is onli my teacher talk and i just have to watch and listen i dont jave to do to much i just ask question
you can paus to write your note and then afterward we have a live discuss or a discuss in chat so it’ still interact and you can ask question
i can easili go back and replay anyth i didn’t understand the first time and tri to get a grasp of it
i like have the face to face contact as it feel the most “normal” and you can hear everyone’ idea opinion
zoom can becom extrem tire after all class on zoom so when i get assign that i get to do offlin and through other platform individu i feel i am more energ and healthi
a combin of share document amd live class
becaus then i actual get some work done dure team meet we rare actual learn anyth it just chat which is nice but not what i go to lesson for
i prefer the interact aspect eg for ask question live
immedi discuss are more insight
more flexibl
it’ still like we are in the classroom and point are explain in more depth than just read from a text
becaus i find when the lecturevideo is record it much clearer at teach that particular subject then on zoom where the wifibroadband can be less reliabl and the teacher is less organis and can rambl on without go into detail about the actual subject they are teach that day
abl to rewatch until i get a certain topic
becaus we get the same feel as regular school
sein peopl bring abl to talk with each other more direct
ask question with live feedback
becaus i pay more attent
live class are not as effici sinc they take up lot of time wherea with given materi if they are given enough i am abl to go with my own pace instead of wast my time listen to a whole hour lectur
i feel as though i am actual learn and if i don’t understand i can alway ask for help it feel the most like attend school
for interact between teacher and student
allow me to take in the materi at my own pace on my own schedul
i studi a languag so it’ veri import to practic speak and listen skill
is the quickest and easiest way regard there’ no distract internet connect other student etc
we can ask question to the teacher at the spot it’ like actual school just onlin live at your room
own pace unsuit environ for onlin callw
abl to openli convers with teacher ask question in real time see other student
i have onli been learn by word document and powerpoint that my teacher have been send to me through email i don’t think i would want to particip in a zoom call as i would find it awkward
it allow me to work at my own pace
abl to interact with teacher and lectur
becaus it contain more inform and it is easier to read at anytim
it still feel similar to what univers wa like befor hand therefor not unsettl
these are veri inform and basic like a class discuss although i found them a bit strang to begin with becaus we all have to have our camera off due to safeguard reason it’ nice to get an insight into what other are do as their coursework and for my other subject it’ nice to get more interact out of the lesson than you would in a lesson
it is easier to make note and flexibl method
sociabl interact and abl to ask question straight away
more interact
make sure i attend requir involv and more engag
i prefer the interact that it allow for can ask professor question and professor can ask us question to engag us
i’m given all the resourc i need and am happi to complet the work
actual learn stuff and explain as we usual would have them
there is no time commit and so it’ more flexibl i also don’t like be on a webcam person so i find the anonym of watch a pre record lectur less stress
give motiv and a set time to complet work along will chanc to ask question
it forc me to get the work done as i have to attend
all inform organis in one place and can keep go back to view
becaus you can manag your own time and decid when to do what task
i feel like i can learn much more and understand more when i’m work at my own pace when we’r do live session i have difficulti keep up with the teacher but then i understand the materi when they send us paper or exercis or written explan by mail
it more live and give more motiv im also learn betterav thi way
it’ as interact as face to face can be
i feel like live class work better for me as i seem to find the teacher goe into more depth when explain then they do on just upload work
it feel more activ rather than record thing i feel as if less peopl would watch these if not super motiv though i wouldnt mind have some precord class becaus onlin class arent the best it feel veri one side becaud the class is 99 of the time quiet with no camera so i actual feel realli sorri for the teacher discuss chat dont work we tri it though
more interact and engag
you can interact with classmat and ask question to the tutor directli
it is a bit more similar to normal class you can activ engag with the teacher and fellow student howev you are still abl to look some inform up without disturb the class
you get immedi feedback and benefit from interact with other student
there is an increas chanc of engag with lectur and get an immedi respons as oppos to email the live class also serv as motiv to attend the class in real time
you have proper interact and can get correct and feedback live
it feel more like the classroom set make me feel more motiv as an activ member of the class
if i have question about the lectur i can ask immedi to clarifi it or if i have question from previou lesson i can ask my teacher after make some research to confirm it thi would not be possibl if it wa in record form and some thing are just better understood when explain
sinc everyth is clearli mention and explain
it is the closest to facetofac class
find it easi to keep up with sinc i can paus and play if i miss someth
sinc you don’t have to forc dedic a specif hour time that mainli just work for your teacher and not you if that make sens
it allow us to fo the work in our own time and do independ learn
the teacher can go into depth of the subject
it allow the student to give feedback and ask question in order to clarifi understand
thi allow for interact
so i can watch them when i have time
i actual get live explan on the lesson and in gener i am more focus in lectur than alon in front of cours materi
it’ the closest i got to feel like i wa back in the classroom and there’ also so mani resourc on zoom that allow an effect teachinglearn experi
no limit on time zone and no internet connect issu
becaus it allow you to take fuller note as you can go back over what you miss also becaus it help give you idea to develop your knowledg for the exam rather than simpli be given a homework task and figur out what a text book mean
becaus i can revisit the lectur anytim
i can go at my own pace and at ani time i want
easier to engag in the content and student can ask question
it is much more easier than live class
becaus i can have direct contact with my teacher
becaus you can paus it if you doesnt understand

it’ nice to see people’ face and hear friend and teacher talk and it’ more interact and easier to learn by
becaus it allow for student and teacher interact and it is the closest to the in person class format i am use to
be abl to go back to what is not understood and skip what is
allow you to engag with classmat and the professor live question with immedi answer and have a set class time help stick to a consist scheduleroutin
you can actual see the professor and the student it help me to focu
i learn way more talk to and interact with supervisor than passiv watch a lectur
i can work at my own pace and if i do not understand someth i am abl to do extra research in order to have an adequ understand to complet the work it also help me to plan my day becaus i know what i need to do and when it need to be hand in by
it an account thing i dont think i would get the work done otherwis
the interact and abil to record for futur engag
easier to follow
thi mode is the closest option to tradit classroom learn
inform is easili access in one place and can be perus as often as you need it
i have more freedom to do it at my own pace or free time

you can alway rewatch it if there is someth you dont understand
you can access and watch in your own time and own pace
it enabl me to watch the video onc understand content and then watch it again with time stop a lot to take note my method is quit time consum howev it is a process i enjoy moreov ive alway learnt thi way onlin even befor school close howev my teacher do not upload video just materi to fill and them hand in i also have to point out that i am a year 13 student and we finish learn content in april for the sake of finish the cours
feel like your in the classroom more and can just put your hand up and ask a question make everyth a lot easier and more normal
it easier to paus and look back if you dont understand someth
no stress of “class” and other peopl
easiest to discussask question about the topic so concept can be explain in multipl way so everyon can understand as often pupil are expect to read the inform from a textbook with no further discuss around the topic
it accommod multipl timezon it also make it easier if for some reason you had to miss a class you dont feel complet lost
i like hear the instructor talk through the big idea of the lesson and hear and see other student i guess i like the face to face although virtual connect i also like record lectur
you can take note and ask question you are held account creat routin
it is fun and you get to hear other student point of view instead of just readingwrit about the subject
more interact
abl to go at my own pace
most like real life
more interact
easier to ask question
feel more real if it’ timet into my day
becaus dure live session student includ myself are more like to watch the materi and particip rather than dure record lectur when we do not have the opportun to ask question or particip in the lectur

becaus it‘ the most interact mode and resembl live class at uni the most
interact
it make it easier to work in one own pace
i feel more motiv to studi and feel more engag as it is real time
i can rewatch the lectur on my own time and alter the speed to skip over administr stuff
sometim miss import live inform
be abl to watch the lectur on your own schedul and be abl to pauz adjust the speed and go back to someth you didn’t understand quit well is realli work out great for me
most interact easiest to pay attent feel most like have real life contact and discuss with professor and student
it is more interact
i enjoy the interact and act see people’ face live
i can studi on my own time
feel more interact and more motiv to take part
i can’t concentr in live class
it is most similar to a classroom scenario which is what i’m use to and most comfort with
give me motiv and structur in my day to complet my work
easier to access the teacher and ask questionshav discuss
it allow me to particip and practic skill not just repeat content
i can do it at my own pace and decid how i want to do it
onlin learn in gener is not work well with me but have the abil to ask lectur question through a chat would help plu you get to see exactli what peopl are ask and take note as for someon who english is their third languag understand speech sometim prove to be difficult
i prefer to work independ so by directli upload the resourc i can use them to do that
caus you can paus and take note whenev you want plu you can watch it when you want
more interact possibl to ask question directli more activ learn forc you to stick to a normal schedul and therefor easier to remain caught up
becaus i find it much easier to take note it’ not realli the best as much as it is the less bad it also is better for me as a disabl student
you get real tine teach
it make sure i have a schedul
so that i am abl to ask question and thi is the closest method to teach regularli
live chat are too stress
i can ask question in the moment
i can work at my own pase and if i have ani question i can first check back with my friend and then ask the professor
it is easier and more effici to ask the teacher question in real time as oppos to over email which could confus matter more
i’m a visual learner and i like the flexibl of do assign whenev i want
less awkward forc onlin interact
can go back and rewatch harder concept
it’ easi to ask question as the teacher is alway activ also it is a bit more “human” and nice to have an excus to speak to friendspeer
can learn at own pace
set my own pace
it is much more interact and help me more becaus it harder to teach myself content
get to steal other peopl idea and use it for revision😉
opportun to ask question and engag with materi
less independ learn
someth engag and product
it’ more motiv when it’ live as you forc yourself to do it record lectur sometim feel option even if it is not
i like visual written inform as oppos to an auditori and visual lectur video
becaus i can go back to it hit paus etc which help me understand the materi better and becaus it make me more flexibl time wise
it help me to learn and understand the content
it is a lot more interact we can ask the teacher question and it feel a lot more like an actual lesson
much easier to ask question and get assist
it come closest to the normal way of have class
i can work at my own pace when suit me
give us more of an opportun to discuss queri
it doe depend on the class i like the combin of live class and record lectur live class are great for ask question in tutor class and discussionbas content wherea record lectur allow me to follow my own schedul and revisit part i found difficult to understand i can paus the lectur when i need to think more about the present concept on the other hand live class structur my day and hold me account i think all of the abov mention mode should be employ for successful onlin teach as they cater to differ need
thi way you can understand the work given much better when discuss and to get a rang of thought and opinion from other
you can go through the materi in your own pace and can do so peac or with other in your class
i can read thing at my own pace and view the context of the work
becaus they are more indepth clearli have more time spent on them all are prerecord from last year in live chat there can be bufferingno audioaudio from student watch program
you can more easili engag with the content and can also ask question if you are stuck
be abl to see my instructor prevent me be as lone and improv my gener mood the experi is also more personalis to us as individu student
i can plan my own schedul
it doesnt reli on a strong internet connect on both end no interrupt can be use to revisit a topic
the closest to have the class inperson
it feel the most „normal”
when class are pre record i tend to procrastin more
becaus it is a more interest than onli read text the whole day becaus of the audio or pictur and i like that i can paus anytim
you can go at your own pace rewatch and paus when necessari
i prefer have a schedul to follow and i gener feel i take more inform in and get more from an interact class be abl to ask question at the end of a lectur is someth im miss due to the move onlin
most similar to normal classroom abil to interact
i like have the abil to go back and rework through content if i dont understand it in the first place
it allow me to creat an effici schedul
more interact can easili ask question feel more person not robot
it easier for me to keep up with everyth my professor are say and i can paus an back the video up everi time i need to
more interact and therefor i learn a lot more from them abl to access the tutor immedi if i have ani question
it give me the flexibl to watch the lectur when it suit me best and it make it possibl to look back at some lectur when i need to
complet at own pace
teacherstud contact and present of exact appropri way to solv given problem
i have no problem with the mode now use i am an independ learner and am thankfulenjoy it howev mani of my classmat and friend are struggl and they are in need of live interact which my school and district ha not implement furthermor my attend is suffer although i turn in my work on time and all
have prerecord lectur enabl me to work at my own pace and plan out my own day
easier to ask question can flag up ani issu as soon as they occur some semblanc of normal abl to interact with peer teacher is avail and onlin better for explain more complex concept
becaus we get to interact and appli the materi more activ
we can interact with the teacher and make question in real time
record lectur are good i guess as some includ myself may have poor internet also they contain all the content about the particular topic and we can play paus whenev we cant understand a particular thing and contact our professor to ask about it
becaus it enabl me to interact with both my teacher and classmat and creat a feel of a real classroom
more conveni and open to less technolog error etc
the teacher can teach still but there isnt the awkward of a live class
it give all the inform without interrupt
it’ a lot easier to understand and they’r usual easier than live lectur
engag
becaus you can still verbal commun with lectur
abil to organis learn freeli and to adapt it to your own learn speed ie rewatch certain part paus
becaus you can interact with your lectur class mate ask question and it make it seem more real prerecord lectur leav me with minim motiv and don’t feel like i am complet my degre
i feel the school spirit more which motiv me more in these lazi time where the bed is next to may desk
it allow the lectur to fit it better with other commit swing in mental health
i feel like live lectur and zoom call disadvantag student from differ time zone who may have to stay up late or wake up extrem earli to take these class it also allow me to go back and take extra note if i need to
abl to have live chat and join the discuss easili and hear opinion quickli
enabl me to go over the lecturemateri again whenev requir for greater understand
becaus it resembl normal class
more interact
nearest thing to a real life lectur
i can go back to the lectur and just watch the part i don’t realli get
make it easi to stop and take in the inform go away and look someth up to come back to it
it’ interact and closest to the classroom environ
i am abl to be in charg my time i spend as much as i need on one topic then anoth without stress
becaus it is most engag and mean i can paus it and learn at my own pace
i understand the content better when it is spoken to me and can ask question as i think of them like a normal class
most clear and natur explan from teacher similar to in class so i understand and rememb the content much better
littl interact and easi to get all info with out disrupt
it still is a bit interact and allow us to manag our time as we can and want to the voic and presenc of a teacher is also much more engag than a mere document
record lectur give the least amount of technic difficulti for student and it give you the time and space to learn at your own speed
interact and explan directli from teacher also a lot more motiv
becaus i can interact with my teacher and discuss with mu friend easili also i can ask my teacher immedi if i didnt understand ani point
you can watch them on your own timet
it would be more help and use than live class which you might not be abl to attend and upload materi which may be hard to get through yourself without guidanc
it is most similar to regular class
live class are messi becaus there are a lot of peopl internet connect get unstabl and i just find unrequir joke of my peer stupid sometim offens and gener distract
more like to be engag in the work and get direct feedback
abl to paus replay subtitel
possibl to interact and ask question schedul similar to in person class
it most engag
becaus it’ interact
becaus it allow us to interact directli with our teacher
it is self direct learn and offer a sens of clariti and the learn materi content
you focu on understand it onc and for all
the onli one i know although discuss forum sound interest might just be a littl difficult for my subject
so that to have an interact class and ask question in realtim
becaus i concentr when watch lectur video and i understand more
more engag than upload materi with the abil to access the lessoncont at one conveni
is the best option
live class
i think i learn better on my own time plu be abl to rewind is alway help
we can ask question immediatli and it is a set timeslot i have to do the lectur which help me to organ myself
you’r abl to appli your learn and most importantli interact with other peopl ask question share idea debat etc it make me more account for my learn
there is a chanc for interact and also a higher motiv to keep up the timet and particip
i can work in my own flow and at my prefer time
creat a sens of be in an actual class
more engag
i can watch the lectur when it is an appropri time for me
theyr conveni if i dont want to attend class at the alloc time
it’ the closest thing to a facetofac learn
it is more similar to usual school
becaus it’ easi and comfort
i have enough time and i can watch them whenev i want
if everyon ha read everyth it work as well as normal class and we are practic problembasedlearn at my uni so that the class are the most interest part all the time
it conveni
it becaus upload materi compil everyth and mostli becaus you can just download it and check it while you are offlin assum you have internet issu
becaus there is no time bound compuls to attend the class i can do it at my conveni
easi and flexibl
i can studi whenev i want
thi is the closest option to the real thing it ha a space for live interact and understand
becaus it is the closest to a face to face class also becaus it good for procrastin
basic for the possibl of live interact with the rest of the class and especi with the teacher
becaus you get to interact with peopl and it’ easier to ask question if anything’ unclear thi way
becaus materi that were sent by email build up live class allow me not to procrastin and to learn thing on time
it obvious not perfect but give us at least the chanc to stop the teacher and ask him if we feel lost about someth the interact are import my second favorit method would be record lectur you fell most comfort and can rewind if youv miss some part without be embarrass to ask the teacher to repeat
becaus i can adjust the speed of the lectur thu optim studi time plu i can stop whenev a term or concept is ambigu to search it on my own
becaus of my slow internet connexion
becaus of how slow the internet is zoom lectur cant be conveni all the time howev when the lectur is record you can studi with no interrupt and you can alway go back to that lectur if you forget someth
